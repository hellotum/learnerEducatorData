0,u9s82g,2022-04-22 23:52:11,CollegeRant,My sociology class sucks.,"Here’s the thing, I’m a Sociology major and I hate the Sociology class I’m taking. It’s an online class, the professor is pretty tough at grading, and it’s my worst class. I have had an F for most of the semester and finally got a D average. The reason is because my professor has VERY clear explanations on how she wants things done. The papers we had to do were a pain in the butt. We had to do two pages about a certain prompt but for me, it was always difficult because I never had enough information for two pages so I got 50% on each of the papers I did. The exams were difficult and for the most part, I did terribly, often because I didn’t understand enough of the content. I have one more week of normal classes before finals. I can’t wait till summer break…

TL;DR-Me ranting about how I hate one of my classes for different reasons like the paper prompts being too difficult, the exams being difficult, and the class where I’m suffering the most. Not to mention the professor being a tough grader.",1,1,XxAuroraFrostxX
1,u8ip8v,2022-04-21 08:25:14,CollegeRant,Nightmare professor. At my limit.,"Buckle up. I want to start this by saying that I have excelled in reading and writing ever since I could hold a pen or flip the page of a book. It's not hard to me, and I was acing college English courses in 8th grade. I was completely done with college English by 10th grade, and skipped 11th grade altogether, but it didn't matter since I'm going to art school for 2d character animation in the fall.

Onto the point, my boyfriend struggles with English a LOT. Not by any fault of his own, mind you. He's dyslexic and didn't get an elementary or middle school education due to parental neglect during childhood. He was thrown right into high school and was told to figure it out for himself. Now he's in college, and decided to pick an English professor that was offering ""extra help"" since he knew he would struggle. About a month in, he comes to me freaking out because his grade was a 20%. Turns out the so-called ""extra help"" the professor offered was just a link to an article written by someone else with advice on how to keep focussed during school. I said 'fuck it' and picked up his class pretending to be him. I know it's cheating. I don't care. This professor is a NIGHTMARE.

I keep waiting for her to teach, but there are never any lessons. Only assignments. It's an online freshman-level class and she never does Zoom meetings or anything of the sort. She ONLY hands out assignments. An outline, classmate critique, and 5-page essay are due once a week on the topic of her choice. These assignments have to be done a VERY specific way. Each slip up, no matter how small, is at least 10 points off of the assignment's total grade. She does not give helpful feedback if she gives feedback at all. Her instructions are very vague, and her email responses to questions are either moody and unhelpful or are sent to you AFTER the assignment has passed its due date. She does not accept overdue assignments, so her unwillingness to respond in time is most infuriating. She assigns scientific essay topics, yet requires the use of unscientific and biased sources. Our most recent essay had us use a ""documentary"" made by a self-proclaimed alt-right conspiracy theorist. Yes, she meant for us to use it seriously. I was flabbergasted to say the least. Before you ask, her RMP score is an impressive 2 stars. Most of her reviews say the same stuff I have. It's common consensus that she actively tries to chase students away so that she can have a smaller, easier to manage class. Unfortunately, by the time he came to me for help, it was too late for the college to let him switch professors.

I say none of this out of saltiness from bad grades. Every assignment I've done has been at least an A. Well, except for the most recent one, where she gave me a 0% for the name at the top of the assignment not ""matching the roster"". For context, my boyfriend is trans. This has NEVER BEEN A PROBLEM BEFORE. He uses that name in every class with every professor, the college recognizes that as his name, and *he has been using that name for her assignments since the beginning of her class*. His name only became an issue with her when he started turning in passing assignments. Honestly I'm at my limit with this witch. We sent her proof that the college recognizes that name as his. If she doesn't do a 180 and apologize I plan to take this to the Dean. I feel like outright discrimination paired with the uncomfortable favoring of alt-right sources is more than enough to get him switched to a different English class.

TL;DR: I love English. This teacher wants class to be boring and difficult. Vague instructions, required use of unscientific sources, extremely harsh grading, constant essays, etc. Potential discrimination to add to the list. I'm at my limit.",1,1,Novel-Ad-2082
2,u8cdnx,2022-04-21 01:53:09,CollegeRant,I dropped out,"Tl;dr I dropped out of college in my last semester of my senior year because of my mental health

I dropped out of college in the middle of my last semester of my last year. I go to a school 4 hours away from my family. Last fall, my grandparents died in a car accident and I was basically forced to mourn them in isolation (because of distance, online classes, busy friends, etc.) Last semester was awful but I managed to make it through with B’s and C’s. I started heavily drinking though. This current semester my suicidal thoughts and self-harm habits hit me like a ton of bricks. I hated my apartment, my friends, my school, and most of all myself. I was drinking 2 bottles of wine a day and struggling to even get out of bed and go to class. I dropped out and checked myself into a psych ward for 6 days. Now that I’ve been out for a few weeks it’s starting to hit me that I dropped out when I only needed 3 more classes to graduate. I feel like a failure, but I know that if I had kept going the way that I was, it would’ve literally killed me. I have no motivation to go back either, I was a straight A student up until this point- in the honors college with a merit scholarship and everything. I hate that I dropped out because I feel like I’ve disappointed the old me who loved learning. But I couldn’t take it anymore.",1,1,Idkwhatimdoimgheree

4,u2asy1,2022-04-12 22:10:54,CollegeRant,just tired of dealing with a condescending impossible to please professor,"I'm in my second semester of grad school and I am just exhausted and feel awful. I'm taking a learning theories class and I've never had a professor be so condescending or make me feel so stupid in my entire life. I am well aware of the fact that my writing is not one that would win me any awards, but in order to get into grad school you have to show skill in your writing. In all my other courses none of my professors have complained about my writing, other than a grammar mistake here or there but never the actual content of my writing. But this professor just seems like she has a problem with everything I turn in as this class is 100% writing based. My grades have been steadily decreasing since the class began, I've never had my grades this low in my life. I just feel like no matter what I do, no matter what corrections I make I can't please this woman. I feel like I listen to corrections she gives and then she just finds something or she has a problem with the corrections I did make. 

The other problem with the class is a lack of instruction. We have 2 writing assignments due every week, an individual paper and a group paper but the instructions she gives are practically non-existent. She reuses the same vague rubric for each assignment. She took points off my last assignment because I didn't use specific enough examples from the Tedtalk she made us write about.  Even though the instructions were to pay attention to when he talks about""good teachers eat apples"" which was only 10 seconds of the video and somehow we were supposed to know that we had to connect it to very specific vocabulary words in our textbook. She also said I didn't write enough, and I need to focus more on the individual assignment rather than the group assignment because it is worth more. Which i find ridiculous because there is only a  10 point difference between them and I can only bs so much in my writing. Also one of my friends in the class had emailed her to ask about page requirements at the beginning of the class and she got a very condescending response that if there ever is a page requirement that it'll be stated in the instructions. And she just sent an announcement today to the entire class that says if we're not writing at least 1 page every week we're not writing enough. It just doesn't feel fair that she has such strict expectations for our work without giving specific instructions or a real rubric. 

It's just so frustrating, trying to navigate this class, especially because it's completely online. It's just trying and honestly the comments she's been making on my assignments just make me feel like the biggest idiot and like I don't deserve to be in the program, even though I now I worked my ass off to get this far. I am not the only one in my class that feels like this, a bunch of us had a venting session about the professor yesterday after she put in grades, and I had a good crying session over it today.. honestly I am not sure how I'll make it through the rest of the semester, there are only 4 weeks left, but it's an accelerated course so it's only 8 weeks to begin with, we're only halfway through and I just feel like breaking down and giving up. All I know is that I plan on leaving a scathing review about the professor once evaluations are due. 
If you made it this far thanks for reading my rant, I just needed to get it off my chest.",1,1,Theycallmebarly

6,u0nqvh,2022-04-10 18:30:15,CollegeRant,Blowing off some Academic Steam and Frustration (4/10/2022):,"Hello College Rant,

I'm currently a junior pursuing Business Management with a minor in Marketing. I started college as a senior in high school (2018-2019 academic school year) and have been attending every semester except for the summers. I originally started at a community college in the city I grew up in but moved to a nearby city to continue my education at a university. While I've only failed one class, I have mentally struggled to see the light at the end of the tunnel with my academic life. 

My first ""real"" semester of college was spent in my hometown while all of my high school friends moved away. I was sad and felt alone, but made the best of it. The classes weren't too difficult and I often felt like I could accomplish my academic obligations on top of work, hobbies, and freetime. The loneliness started to outweigh the enjoyment of college, so I moved to the city all of my friends and girlfriend live in. I didn't specifically choose this school just because my friends went here, but because it also had many more students, I could finally live on my own for a bit, and I could be closer to the people I am friends with.

My first semester at the university was tough. I had to take a calculus course and I was a full-time student, no job, and lived on campus. Everyone was extremely loud at all hours of the night. I could barely wake up on time for classes it felt like and while everyone got to hang out and do fun things, I felt trapped in my dorm room all day. I felt a breath of fresh air as the pandemic hit, but it hurt me more after I got to breathe for a moment. I had to move back to my parents house and do classes online. My motivation tanked, I didn't find enjoyment in classes, and the math course was absolutely kicking my ass.  


August of 2020 rolls around and I move into my first apartment with my girlfriend. It had no windows facing any grass, it felt cramped, and was arguably a hell hole for the both of us. My focus kept drifting, my ADHD felt like it was getting worse, and I was giving up. I had to take two accounting courses throughout the 2020-2021 academic school year, and it drove me up the wall. I would sit in every lecture, the library to study, and would work and work so hard to pass these courses. I got the bare minimum, I mean literally less than 1-2 percent away from failing these courses after dedicated time and effort towards the classes. So I gave up. I stopped going to class, I slept all day, I couldn't take it. I had to go to therapy for anger management about my homework and I was consistently losing my mind. Every lecture, especially in a business college, is filled with frat and sorority people who do not shut the hell up during the lecture. It's annoying, but I am too quiet and reserved to tell someone to shut up so I can hear. 

August of 2021 hits. I am dealing with crap professors. This specific one made my life hell. It was some media managing class and she would consistently email my group saying we weren't getting things done or that it looks unprofessional. She totally turned me off on the idea of taking a class with her again. Luckily that was the easiest semester I've had. No math courses. I could sort of breathe. I had a way to get away from campus and people as we moved to a better apartment and I picked up a hobby car as it's my true passion, not business. I do business because I have no desire to study anything at college and won't become a mechanic because it will absolutely rot my body from itself before I'm 40. My parents, regardless of what they tell me, have expressed that college is the only way at this point. I can't relate to my girlfriend because she's amazing at her studies and I'm literally disconnected from my studies. I just don't care, but I can't be bullied the rest of my life by people for being a college drop out or letting society make me feel worth less than someone who does complete their degree.

It is now April, I'm doing fuck all in this worthless stats class and excel class. I don't fucking care anymore. I have one more year of hell if I don't fail classes. Every semester, about a month before the semester stops strangling me, I start to lose my ability to see anything other than assignments, papers, due dates, exams, quizzes, missing this, missing that, fucking extra work I have do to survive. I don't get the opportunity to calculate my classes to see if I'm fucked or not, because the teachers don't upload shit for me to check in and see or not. I've done tutoring, I've shown up to classes, I've balanced my time. Yet I have no time for me. I have time to slave away at the scam that is college and not get to do what I want, ever. If I make time for myself, it involves saying fuck school and that stresses me out too much. My chest and back fucking hurt all the time from sitting and doing school-work related bullshit. I don't give up easily, but I have a stats exam tomorrow that I know I'm going to absolutely fucking tank because I don't have the desire to learn about something as useless as population proportion.

Colleges make you take these classes not because you need to, but because they want the money out of you to take them. College is structured so poorly for someone like me. I can't fucking sit in a class with like 200 people and not hear the mouth-breathing idiot frat guy behind me singing some dumbass song. I can't balance paying my fucking rent with a full-time college schedule. If I cut to part-time, it increases the time I have until graduation by fucking months to years. It is absolutely absurd how much socializing I don't get to do anymore and how little of a life I feel like I'm living when I am spending 6 AM - 10 PM stressing and heart-aching my way through the fuckery that is college.

I hate this place. When I graduate, you bet your fucking ass I won't walk on that stage. I don't care. I'll be proud of myself for graduating, but I am losing my fucking mental sanity with the amount of utter bullshit that comes with this degree. And don't forget all of the memes that make out business students to be idiots and not know what the fuck is going on. I hate how my major is perceived by other people. I get memes sent to me about how business is the easy major and people there are idiots and it makes me feel like shit all the time because I am struggling to see myself pass every single semester. I don't know how I've passed the last few semesters but I am starting to struggle and feel like the blood is rushing to my head everytime I see my grade go down because it's wasted money and it's wasted time and in this life I am trying to waste as little time doing shit I hate. I can't bitch to people I know in person because then my family starts to stress out and my girlfriend starts to stress so I'd rather be fucking quiet and not hurt them and just be fucking pissed here than anywhere else. The therapy barely works. I can't fucking stand to waste more time sitting in a room telling someone I have anger problems because I have to take bullshit I don't want to take. 

&amp;#x200B;

God damn that felt good to let out. I'm okay. I'm going to make it. I just, theres great things about college and then there are a lot of bad things. Not everything is bad and I truly am thankful to receive a college education even if I fail out somehow and don't complete my degree. I just want to be out working and spending my weekends doing my own things and not on stupid assignments.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR I started college feeling okay and it's progressively killing my happiness. I can't see the light at the end of the tunnel and I don't want to deal with it.",1,1,Spoon_Microwave
7,u0141e,2022-04-09 20:05:09,CollegeRant,"My Art History Professor is Absent, Careless, and Inconsistent at Best","Right now I’m taking the second of two art History classes with the only professor that teaches them at my university. Both sections are online and asynchronous. This class has been extremely boring and I’ve learned very little. I honestly don't see how I'll need any of the information that I've learned in the future. I understand being required to take ONE art history course to be ""cultured"" but TWO? Come on, that's just cruel, especially since you have to put up with this woman ""teaching"" it in two parts in two semesters. If anything, the textbook, khan academy videos and articles, and google have taught me, not her. We’ve focused almost entirely on European art in both sections with almost nothing on the other continents until now. These however aren’t my main gripes with her and this course.

I’m insanely frustrated because the previous section of this course taught by her was at least consistent, however the second is insanely inconsistent. She's the only one teaching them and I've taken them back to back. I took Art History I in the fall and I'm taking Art History II this semester. The professor hardly does much of anything. The communication at least has stayed the same from fall semester. She will communicate maybe once every other week or even every two weeks if you’re lucky with a basic announcement about the next assignment, project, or test. Grading is even worse. She hasn’t done any grading in over a month and often times there are several mistakes in her grading when she grades something herself and when canvas isn't doing her job for her. Some weeks we just don’t have any work to do, like this week. We didn’t hear from her at all this week and there was nothing to complete at all. Last semester she gave us weekly smaller assignments all due at the end of the semester rather than occasional long tedious ones that are due on Saturday nights. I’m perfectly fine having a week or two off, in fact, I welcome it, but it seems like half the weeks of the semester that were supposed to be work weeks so far have been “weeks off” with absolutely no new content.

Her exams are some of the hardest ones I’ve ever had to take. She will have 18 question tests that don’t seem bad until you’re doing them. They are mostly multiple choice or matching with a few short answer questions. Doesn't sound too hard does it? I thought so too until I took them. For a multiple choice or matching question she will have a question with two pictures of two random unlabeled art pieces with a word in the middle and we have to say whether the left, right, both, or neither piece are that word. Usually this word is something I haven't even seen in the textbook and have to google what it is because it isn't even in the textbook index. For a ""short answer"" she always has us compare and contrast two pieces after identifying them as well as saying what we learned from the comparison. I hate the identification part because I have to search in the textbook forever just to locate the two pieces. She basically expects us to memorize a bunch of pieces and their titles, artists, era, and locations going by how they look. This is ridiculous. I’m a human not a robot with recognition software! So, rather than study I just search the textbook while I take a test since they are thankfully open note open textbook. This can have varying results though because sometimes she will include something that definitely isn’t in the textbook. The tests have taken me over two hours to complete just because she refuses to label the pictures of pieces or make short answer questions actually short. 

I don’t know what her problem is but she seems to be either careless, lazy, or perhaps preoccupied with something else she thinks is more important than her job. Now that’s fine if she has some other stuff to worry about until it deeply affects the learning experience a bunch of young adults are PAYING her for which it is! I'm paying her to improperly and lazily effort-free do her job! I expect quality for what I pay and in return I'm being force-fed bullshit from a lazy ex-high school principle turned online art history instructor. I expect better. We all have other things going on, but she just doesn't put in enough effort to her job. She comes off so lazy and careless likely because in the age of online learning colleges get away with providing mediocrity for overpriced tuition fees. They know they will get paid no matter what especially if they are tenured so they just don't give a shit anymore and do whatever they feel like doing just because they can. I just wish she would put in a little more effort and actually make this class worthwhile. All her materials are old or not even hers. Most of her material comes from this terrible textbook that was probably written by a friend or something as well as khan academy. She doesn't even interject much of her own thinking. Her monotone lifeless emotionless thinking would probably make everything worse though so it's hard to say. Her slides are literally just photos and her lectures are just rambles describing each piece visually so I quit watching them because there is no useful information in them that I didn't already see in the textbook. I don’t feel like I’m getting my money’s worth. I feel cheated out of half of it. I just can't wait until spring semester is over and I don't have to deal with her laziness anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: 

My Art History teacher is terrible. She hardly communicates, never grades, assigns difficult tests with vague and unrelated questions, and is overall inconsistent as all hell.",1,1,Retrocade86
8,tyyd3f,2022-04-08 07:53:06,CollegeRant,Always create your own groups for projects don't use auto pick," 

So for my stats class, we had a project worth 14%. We are put into groups of 4 however you need at least 3 people to complete the project if it's less than that you fail. One of my group members disappeared after being added to the chat so now it's just the three of us. I keep texting in the chat pushing for work to be done no response or response hours later. One of my group members did work however he didn't read the instructions where we had to use SPSS or Excel to do calculations and he used online calculators. Not until after I hand in the assignment did he tell me he didn't use excel when I was asking him to send me his excel data 2 days prior to the due date there goes easy fucking marks. Now you may be wondering where the 3rd guy is at, this asshole sends a message hours before the due date saying he hasn't been taking this class seriously so he doesn't know what he's doing so he can't do any work and apologizes. 

Now I'm forced to still put his name down because we need at least 3 people for the project.

So I'm doing most of the work and now my mark will suffer because I was put into a group with dimwits. We were given the option to find group members as well but I didn't do that cause it was an online class and I didn't know anyone so I let it auto-picked for me. Learning from this never use auto pick cause most of the time it's just people who don't push themselves to do anything.

I don't even know if I should email the prof or the TA about the situation since it's kind of too late now. I'm just so frustrated with the fact that my already solid mark for this class is going to go down due to bad circumstances outside of my control.",1,1,TheCaseofTopGunna
9,tyjqs2,2022-04-07 18:43:38,CollegeRant,Department Head is ghosting me after refusing to give me my completed minor [rant],"TLDR included at end, because this is a long one. So in 2019 I decided I wanted to transfer from one university (biomedical engineering major) to another university (mechanical engineering major). I was still super interested in BME, and noticed there was a bioengineering minor at the new school. Immediately, before transferring in 2019, I set up a meeting with the new university’s advisors to figure out what courses I could take for the minor. It’s the only minor that requires advisor approval and doesn’t include a straightforward list of courses, and I found that no advisor could really tell me what to take. Most of the feedback was “let’s just focus on your major”. I decided to then, work towards the minor following the requirements online, and as of last spring (2021), I have completed all of the requirements. I emailed my advisor for approval, which she would not give because the minor was to be discontinued for students graduating past 2022. Due to an advisor mistake during transfer, I have to graduate in 2023 because there is a class that does not exist until spring 2023 that I need for graduation. Now when starting this minor, there was no information on discontinuation and since I had already completed it, I assumed I would be grandfathered in; however, this has not been the case. My advisor said there’s nothing she could do, talk to the department head. I met with him and he said it was out of his control and to talk to the BME department. I met with the BME coordinator who said it’s a registrar issue. I talked to their registrar who told me the university policy says that my advisor can still add this minor. I go back to my advisor and she says I need to contact the department head again. I email him and get no response at all. I send a follow up, and again no response. I have no idea what to do next but i’m fuming because as of this semester I will have completed 40 credits for this minor (more than double that is needed, I wanted to be super safe and genuinely enjoy biology). I just seriously don’t understand why no one can help me with this and just sends me on a wild goose chase. I put in so much work to get this minor and it’s crushing that I have to graduate a year late and possibly without a minor I worked so hard for. 

TLDR: Completed a minor that is discontinued for students graduating after this year (which includes myself) and my advisor refuses to add it even though it’s university policy that she does, and the department head hasn’t responded to my emails regarding this matter.",1,1,IndividualProduce406
10,txqbay,2022-04-06 16:37:58,CollegeRant,"Stupid ""chapel"" requirements","So I go to a Christian University and I have been (mostly) content with my college experience so far. There is one requirement that has kinda put me over the edge right now which is why I am writing here. Basically, they have mandatory chapel attendance, which is usually offered around lunchtime for an hour most Mondays through Fridays. 

Honestly, this is such an unreasonable requirement. Students scramble every semester to meet these requirements. If you don't meet them, they charge you $20 per missing credit along with other academic punishments. 

The only way to get excused is if you work more than 35 hours a week, are a full-time student, and commute. Are you kidding me? I am studying nursing and last semester I had classes that conflicted with the available time that chapel was offered 2 days out of the week, and then clinical on Wednesdays that also conflicted. I am a commuter so I only came to campus a few times to get these credits. That's money out of my pockets to attend chapel. To add to that, I was assisting my grandpa with his doctor's appointments during some of my days off and using that time to study.

This semester, my only day on campus is Mondays. I have been coming most Mondays and Fridays (again a day off) to catch up on these credits, but I've had some roadblocks. The biggest one was that my grandpa passed away late janurary. Despite that, I managed to get 12 chapel credits this semester. On top of clinical, studying, working, etc. 

Today I had a canceled clinical so I went to campus to get another chapel credit. I arrived before the scheduled time and I was turned away because they were full.  I am not expecting them to break fire regulations, but they have made atrocious expectations like ""leave class 5 minutes early"" among others. They are not being flexible by offering overflow rooms or online classes. 

I honestly do not have the energy to fight. It is a wonder I am showing up to my classes and work right now given that I am still grieving. I am sick of the passive-aggressive comments about this credit. It is an unreasonable expectation, especially if they are beginning to turn people away. 

I want to email them, but I have no idea what to say. I feel so foggy and I am honestly just fed up.",0,1,gh712

I’m also in student teaching right now so every day I go home and plan for hours and then go to bed. I guess my question is, what can I do? And how can I see my own canvas engagement? Im not even sure what it’s based off either so it’s just stressful. Im not sure if anyone else has had this issue but it shouldn’t matter how long I spend on canvas if I submit quality work.",1,1,literallylizz
12,ttgf3m,2022-04-01 02:45:55,CollegeRant,My one friend isn't helping when we work on homework in a group,"I work with three other friends to do homework in a class we have together. The professor not only allows, but encourages this as it's one of those classes where bouncing ideas off each other helps immensely. However, the professor obviously doesn't want us to just copy each other's work (duh). My one friend, I'll call him John, does not contribute to these homeworks whatsoever. He tried before to help but mainly looked stuff up online and didn't really do much other than that. But, it's gotten to the point where me and my other two friends do all of the work and he doesn't do anything except copy our work. When we work in a group, he's just scrolling on his phone and waits for us to get anything. While we stay up late and look at the questions before we meet up, he does not do anything. Yet, he expects us to get the answers and share them. He almost acts entitled about it and it's really starting to make me mad. 

Any advice on what to do? I value my friendship with him and don't want to ruin it over a class.",1,1,seekthegiant

I just got back to campus after 2 sem of online classes and I had trouble adjusting myself into the environment. My major had 128 credit hours needed to be completed. I complete like 12 of them so far for 2 semester and i got 58 subjects left to complete with the remaining 5 sem i have rn. I took 7 subject for this class but i cant even manage to press myself to do some easy fucking task of presentation and i decided to drop out of it just now  since i also got unreasonable absence from ridiculous timer check-in attendance school system. Now im taking 6 class this sem. If i calculate properly i need to take 10.4 subjects class for each sem to complete this course. Or can i just prolong another sem and graduate a little late?

15,tqto2k,2022-03-29 06:40:32,CollegeRant,I fucked up this semester and I don’t know how to bounce back,"I fucked up this semester and I need advice on how to bounce back

For reference, I’m a freshman, 19F. This is my second semester in college and I’ve just realized that I have to drop 2/5 of my classes. I’m likely going to fail a third.

Most of my classes this semester have been online. I can’t stress enough how much I love online class; I can do the assignments on my own time and I can attend class from the comfort of my own home which is awesome for someone like me. That being said, I’m doing well in most of my online classes.

I have an in-person class that I’ve never really cared for. It’s a student taught class and it’s an English credit class but the curriculum itself is not something I have any interest in and feels like bullshit. Besides that the class itself seemed easy enough as long as I showed up to class every day. Guess what I didn’t do?

It was a morning class and I am NOT a morning person. I think I’ve been to a total of 5 classes throughout the semester. Now I’m kicking myself because there are 6 weeks left in the semester and I have to drop this class. Fuck.

Then I realized that the biology course I’ve been taking has a mandatory lab in the mornings that I haven’t been to. It’s going to tank my grade so that makes 2 classes I have to drop.

I’m also in a remedial math course that I’m taking for the 3rd time. I passed it in high school but I failed an entry level test and was placed back in that course. I failed last semester and now I have to take it again. I’m awful at math and I’m pretty certain I’m going to need to retake it but truthfully I don’t know because my instructor hasn’t posted grades all semester. I currently have a N/A in that class.

Besides all this, I’m in a really tough spot. My plan was to move states and schools this summer. I want to transfer to a school in another state but due to this school’s requirements I can’t apply until I have 24 credits (because I don’t meet the &gt;23 requirements) but I don’t know if I’ll have those credits by the end of the semester. I hate where I live, there’s nothing to do and I have no friends. I’m miserable here. My landlord is selling my home at the end of the semester and I don’t know where I’m going to go. I might have to move back in with my parents but I don’t think that’s an option because I have cats and I don’t know if my parents will accept them. I don’t want to open a new lease because of the move I’ve been planning. I feel miserable, alone, and depressed. I hate citing my depression as a reason for anything because it makes me feel so pathetic, but it’s sucking the life out of me. Some days I can’t even get out of bed. 
I’m supposed to go to medical school after I get my bachelor’s but no school worth a shit will accept me. I don’t know how to break it to my parents that I have to drop so many classes, they’re going to kill me. I’m freaked out and I don’t know what to do, besides suck it up and do better next time. Except I don’t know how to do better. I feel stuck.
How do I get out of this rut? Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks

16,tqola2,2022-03-29 01:31:50,CollegeRant,My Statistics Prof Has Made Attendance Mandatory in the Last Month of School and Hasn't Made an Announcement About It,"So I am taking a first year statistics course. The material itself isn't terrible but the prof is a terrible teacher. He's obviously a very smart man and knows what he is doing but he is an awful teacher. He mumbles, so even with a microphone you cannot hear what he says. He does have an accent, which can explain his diction, however he talks so quickly and quietly I don't even have a guess of what he is saying. He also writes very small on the white board, and doesn't change his writing size even after being asked to enlarge it. So majority of the people in our class have stopped attending classes, since all the powerpoints are uploaded online anyways. 

Sometime in March, he decided that he was going to start taking attendance and it was going to affect our final mark. He hasn't said HOW its going to effect our mark, just that it will. He's ending the class early so we only have 1 more class until the end of the semester and he still hasn't said how he'll be fitting an attendance mark into our syllabus. 

He also hasn't sent out an email or announcement that he has started taking attendance and that it will effect our final mark. Now an attendance mark was not apart of our original syllabus and no where on it did it say that attendance was mandatory. The closest thing is says is ""to do well, attend classes regularly."" 

So if you're someone who realizes that attending classes isn't actually helping you learn the material and are more efficient using class time by yourself to learn it, and you don't have any friends in that class, you would be screwed. You would have an entire chunk of your grade missing and you would have no idea why. This isn't a class you need to attend to succeed, just need to practice the materials. 

Do you think I should email someone about this? About him adding something to our syllabus without officially informing the class? As well as not telling as how it will be effecting our mark? Because I can't tell if it's against a policy or if it's just unprofessional of him. Either way, I just really needed to rant about it because it honestly is making me so angry.",1,1,Rich-Bag-8686

19,tn9kjd,2022-03-25 00:19:49,CollegeRant,I keep trying and I keep failing,"I am so sorry this post is really long but it’s a needed vent. 

I’m 18 years old, a junior in college, barely 2 months away from being a senior. I have 3 semester left and I have everything planned out. I want this degree, but I can’t change myself and I can’t really come back from how bad I’m failing. 

I have been “burnt out” for like the last two years. I started my associates degree when I was a high school junior, and I graduated and then finished my associates degree in the next summer semester. I am finishing my third year, and I don’t think there should be another year. 

My struggle started senior year when I got a job, and a few months in I started vaping and smoking 🍃. That is it’s own story, but I was struggling so bad at the time and looking for attention in all of the wrong places because I was so desperate. Tldr of that is I needed to move out. Anyways, I stopped doing both and have been MONTHS clean from the worse of those two. 

So, my entire hs journey I was a straight A kid, and then I got a job and started slipping and the worst grade I got was a B- in my third semester of college/my senior year of hs. After I finished that semester the person I consider my advisor asked me are you going to do better next semester, and I felt like really committed to that and like I didn’t want to struggle so much again. Come my final semester of hs and associates degree, I did even worse. I failed my first class and all my other grades were so horrible for me, and I didn’t get my associates degree until after I took that class again during summer semester. 

Oddly, taking just that one class again was really easy. I got a different job at some point during that story which is related to my personal struggle but that’s the side story so skipping the explanation of all that. I did this class over summer and it was just peaceful. That’s why I thought I was going to get my shit together after this. 

Then I went right back in to get my bachelors degree. Same situation: I thought I was going to make some big change and really turn myself around and succeed but that just didn’t happen at all, and I don’t know what to do. 

Fall semester went okay except for the fact I got dropped from a class because I didn’t attend. I’m all online, so that means I didn’t even get on once a week to do my work and got dropped after two weeks of that. Felt really shitty at the time and I was too late to enroll in it for the last 6 week block of the semester. Whatever, I was just going to retake it next semester. 

That catches my story up to date. This semester I retook that class and scheduled it as the very first one so that I could dedicate myself to it and try really hard from the start. I dropped it again. Then I paid ANOTHER ~1.4K for the course and I actually made it to week 6 by doing the bare minimum but I’m going to fail it because of my grade this time. Even worse, I added another course at the same time as it and got dropped from that after week 3. Even worse..! I am taking courses at my community college and I got dropped from one of those yesterday. I didn’t even know that was a thing there. 16 week courses at my cc and 6 week courses at my main uni are completely different, and I really had no idea I could be dropped from a class at my cc. That’s the worst of it all. I will lose financial aid and this is going to fuck me over. 

I literally did this to myself and I’m stuck in a loop. I keep trying and getting this idea in my head, like I’m going to do this, and I’ll plan it out only to fail again. This time I failed in a completely unexpected way and I had an anxiety attack about it. I opened this email at work yesterday saying I was dropped from the class and I just had to act like I wasn’t seconds away from having a breakdown. Held that in until I got home :) 

At this point, I don’t even know why I keep trying. My dad always wanted me to get a college degree and I’ve always thought I was going to. I technically did it, I got my associates degree, but that doesn’t feel like enough. I never considered anything different, and I think that’s why I keep trying when it’s obvious I need to stop. I’m wasting thousands of dollars. It’s literally my money. I work full time and set up payment plans to pay everything off. I don’t have any student loans, but I’m still wasting my own money doing this. 

This post was mostly just a rant but I appreciate kind words. I cant keep working full time, failing school full time, trying to get my management certificate, and trying to get my real estate license. I think the best course for me is to take a semester off, cut down to like quarter time enrollment, or just drop out. I obviously can’t do this now, and I hope one day that I can finish it later. 

Tl;dr: started failing out my senior year of high school and got my associates degree a semester late because of the first class I failed, faked myself into believing I would change and I’ve wasted so much money to only fail going on four more classes while trying to get my bachelors degree.

I email the professor asking why the review sheet is gone and seconds later I get a note saying the midterm is posted. She never gave a date or time at all. Seconds later the whole class is emailing each other. The professor sends out a blast to the whole class and at the end goes “and the one student who said where’s the review sheet… this isn’t open note. Some of you clearly don’t know how to follow directions”  THEN I go to watch the instructional video and she MENTIONS MY EMAIL AGAIN saying “yeah it’s clear this one student can’t follow directions” so I email her saying “I know how to read and follow directions. I know the exam is closed note. Im just confused as to why the review sheet was posted for only 24 hours and why we never had a concrete date/time of the exam. Usually next week would mean [date]” and this woman had the AUDACITY to write me back calling me condescending and rude. I have never been so upset with a professor.

Ever since high school ended I didn’t know what to do, my parents pushed for college as did most people online so I just did that. Worst decision of my life. I hate college so much and I’m not lying when I state this was when I realized I really do have bad depression and anxiety. Being alone all the time doesn’t help, I don’t even have friends and I wish I were dead. There’s not a single week where things go my way whether that be problems with financial aid or problems with class or stupid professors that get mad over me doing what they asked. 

Seriously y’all, this has gotten pretty bad that I have done things that is otherwise stupid. Guess, I don’t wanna explain that here, but I’m completely lone and I’m depressed and nothing about college has been good. I don’t know what I want, all I know is that I want to stay at home and do nothing. I’ve lost my hobbies because of college, I’ve lost all happiness I still had left because of college. I seriously envy people that say this was their happiest time in life, I don’t get it and I don’t believe you.

23,tjjj3n,2022-03-21 19:14:53,CollegeRant,Snarky Professor,"I am usually a fan of the no-bullshit, no-frills, anti-coddling professors. I have one right now who is strict about housekeeping stuff. He had not said anything too jarring until last week. I asked him a sort of administrative question and he sighed and said ""man I don't know what it is with this class? is it the online learning? did the college change something in the admissions department?"" So, he suggested that I am dumber (and that our class is dumber) and unfit for the college because I asked this one question that was not even answered on the syllabus!

For any professors reading this: Regulate your reactions please. I totally understand a stern response such as ""I have already stated this in lecture"". However, if you are venting or ranting about the quality of students in a ""these fucking kids"" way, then go do that with your professor friends. It is not appropriate to insinuate that someone doesn't deserve to be at the entire college because of one interaction. People have off days and the best we can do is be kind. or : Regulate your emotions!!! You're at work ffs!!!

A lot of the stuff taught in class is high school information. I know some people have to relearn that stuff but it's so boring. The professor makes it a little fun though but everything feels so stiff and awkward. I noticed most of the people in class don't turn in stuff and the people that don't come to class turn in more. I wish I took this class online. Majority of the grade is a 3 part project. I completely missed the first part even though I turned in like 50% if it.

26,tgsnd5,2022-03-18 03:57:37,CollegeRant,"I may be experiencing long term burnout, and I think I need a break.","The spring 2022 semester has not started off great for me. I'm taking 1 online class, and 4 in person classes after years of being remote because of covid. It took me half of the semester to catch up in my online class because I got the online materials late, and had problems accessing the material that I missed (resolved now, but as of midterms I have an F in that class). This problem wasn't my fault, but I still feel unmotivated and discouraged about it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also attending a History class for my gen ed requirement as an Interactive Media major, and man. I don't think I've gotten anything over a C in that class. It consists of lectures that I take notes of, and weekly 5 question quizzes on reading material. We don't have a book in this class. For some reason I'm really struggling with the weekly quizzes, as I can't bring myself to read the lengthy material, and comprehend it, which I think is because of my lack of motivation. I do wish that the quizzes weren't 5 questions and timed though.

&amp;#x200B;

My other classes are doing alright I suppose, but that's not the end of it. I can't seem to get any good sleep because I either wake up randomly throughout the night, or my roommate snoozes her alarm 3 times, let's the door slam closed, and slams her microwave door closed multiple times almost every morning. It drives me nuts, and sometimes keeps me up for a couple of hours until she leaves for class, so I either go back to sleep, or I just can't fall back to sleep. The things she does usually wakes me up a couple hours before my alarm goes off, so me going back to sleep makes me feel terrible once my alarm goes off. My roommate is constantly in and out of the room at random intervals of the day, and it makes me more and more angry as the days pass. I know it's not her fault, but I just enjoy being alone all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

After spring break passed, I realized that I'm currently not happy. I find myself being angry a lot of the time, and I can't bring myself to go anywhere besides classes or to get food on campus. I can't drive me cause I have a vision impairment, so any off campus activities would be very difficult to attend. Having little to no friends kinda sucks, but I'm not too upset about it. More than anything, I enjoy being alone. In my room, in the bathroom, having no one sit next to me in class, etc. I really enjoyed my break because my roommate went home and I got to sleep and do what I wanted. Outside of class and after I do homework, I usually don't have any desire to do my hobbies (gaming, editing, etc).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm honestly so unsure. I know I'm unhappy right now because of the stress from college, but I also don't want to make it seem like I'm just a lazy quitter. I want nothing more than to just be able to get the job that I want, make some money to live comfortably, and be happy somewhere. I felt this burnout feeling since the beginning of high school, and it has yet to go away. School is something I don't really enjoy, however I do enjoy learning about new things that interest me. I'm not sure if any of you know what Voc Rehab is, but I get free schooling because of my disability, which is great, but if I fail my classes or don't graduate in 5 years (I've been in college for 3 now), then they won't sponsor me anymore. The semester is over April 29th and finals start at the beginning of may, so it's almost over, but I don't think I'll make it this semester.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I may fail some of my classes this semester because of lack of motivation. Spring break made me realize that I'm unhappy in school, despite being 3 out of the 5 possible years of college. Sponsorship could be lost, which means no more funds for school.

Sorry for the rant. I just needed to get this off my chest, and wanted to know others opinions on the situation that I'm in. If I don't do too hot this semester, should I take a break? I'm honestly afraid of considering this, but it saddens me to see how my mood has changed.",1,1,AgonisingMoon
27,tfp0h9,2022-03-16 18:40:48,CollegeRant,I don't really expect anyone to read this but im just lonely,"I have been going to college from home since Fall of 2019. I was never able to afford a university, never won any scholarships in high school so I went to a community college instead of the university I was accepted to. 

Growing up my parents were always strict and overprotective, so my life was always go to school and then come home. I never been to any parties, even school-hosted parties there was only like a 40% chance of convincing my parents I could go. My parents had reasons to dissaprove of everyone I could hang out with. Don't hang out with this race/ethnicitiy, don't hang out with this gender, I have a bad hunch about that kid, their parents are prolly racist, you need to focus on school and not friends.

Even when I started community college things never got better, maybe even worse. My friends would go to the mall or go shopping and I was never able to go because I had to come home after class. If I had some extra time in between classes or maybe I told my parents I would study in the library they would convieniently be in class or at work. And when I was in class or at work they would hang out. Our schedules never aligned because I could never make myself available enough.

 On top of that even staying after class to study in the library or get tutoring was hard because my parents assumed I wanted to sneak of and hang out. I did this sometimes not gonna lie, but it was mostly studying in a cafe and doing hw with a friend or two. My first semester of college I was struggling with chemistry so I wanted to get tutoring. My parents were insistent on me staying home, saying why do you have to go out everyday, why can't you use youtube. I told them that its faster to get tutoring than to spend two hours teaching myself a concept on the internet. Eventually the let me go but my dad said ""whatever you are really doing don't bring disgrace to the family name"". I drove to school crying but studied my ass off and got a B in the class. 

Even when I got my first job they were controlling about that too. I used to be a math tutor for my CC. There was this one day I made my mom upset and she threatened that if im going to act like that then I don't have to be working. Pretty much saying that she is allowing me to work and she can take that away too. Im a pharmacy technician now for an inpatient pharmacy and im not even allowed to work evening shifts. Im tempted to pick up an evening shift and tell her that if she doesn't like it she can get another child to be her puppet but im not sure if I will live to see another day.

Then the pandemic happened and I would go months on end without seeing a friend. Even when my school opened up again it was still rare to catch a friend just to chat for a couple minutes before going to a class. 

This semester because of omicron at the beginning of the year and the fact that I rarely ever saw my friends anyways I decided to sign up for asynchronous classes and work a lot. I have good grades, and im making a lot of money (work 32 hours a week) I feel sad and empty. 

Im applying to pharmacy school this year and I will start in august. Im trying to see if I can move out but im afraid I will flake becaue my parents won't approve. I have made plans to move out with my friends before but it never worked out for me because I would chicken out and push the deadline. I would say okay when I transfer to uni I will move, then I pushed it till pharmacy school. 

I want to move out because I feel lonely and sad. Im tired of living restricted. In my parents eyes I have a lot of freedom just because I can drive and have a job and they will only see me as this ungrateful brat. All I do is work and go to school online and nothing else. I don't feel complete as a person and im not equal to my peers",1,1,TheRapidTrailblazer
28,tf3rxj,2022-03-15 23:41:36,CollegeRant,Am I making a mistake transferring to an online college?,"I haven’t done in person classes since my freshman year during Spring of 2020 when everything went online. I got some of the “college experience” but honestly everything went downhill, there was a lot of falling out between my friends I made in my dorms, we all moved back home, etc. In the end I have one friend I made in college left and that’s it. Online classes went fine for the first two quarters but then I experienced a lot of depression and since then it’s kind of gone up and down. I had some quarters where I did okay and some where I didn’t. My financial aid got suspended and I had to repeal it a couple of times because I dropped a couple classes too late into the quarter and that anxiety of feeling like a failure prevented me from doing as well. I’ve had a lot of other random things happen to like getting kicked out of my living situation and having no where to live for a bit during one quarter.

The last few months I’ve done a lot of healing and am doing better but have felt like I’m stuck at my old university because I’ve just been taking random classes online I have no passion for unsure of what I wanted to do and now I don’t think I could get into any majors and after this quarter I think I’d be kicked off of getting financial aid anyways. I’ve been working about 40 hours a week for the last year and it’s honestly brought me a lot of fulfillment and gave me a sense of purpose during the pandemic. My job has a program that will pay for my tuition through certain schools but the classes are online. I applied and got accepted to a reputable school and plan to start classes soon. 

My problem is, I’m worried I’ll regret permanently moving online. My brain says logically it makes sense to move online because I won’t go into anymore debt, I’ll finally been on a path of study, and I can work full time which I’ve loved doing and I have lots of awesome coworkers I can be around. I want to open my own business someday so I feel like the less debt the better. I’m worried though that I’ll miss the rest of my “college experience” like going to class, making friends, studying in the library, eating at the dining hall, etc. I’m almost 22 now though and live on my own and financially support myself so I’m getting a bit older and I feel like most people my age won’t be trying to make new friends at college because we’ve been in college for a long time now plus I’m pretty shy. I also haven’t done those things in 2 years since before the pandemic. I don’t even know if another college would accept me and I’d have to move and leave my job because there’s only one college near me aside from a community college. I just don’t know if the college experience is worth changing my life and going into more debt for and I might not even make more friends. I really needed to vent and any advice is appreciated.",1,1,thequeenofcows

I’m in my first year of college, this semester I have one hybrid class the other two are online. This semester has by far been so much harder than the last one. I’m taking a Chem class a math class and history. I’m failing all 3. 

I don’t consider myself dumb by any means. I just struggle so much with motivation and procrastination. I want to and try to dedicate time to studying and actually doing my homework but everything also gets pushed to the last minute. I say I’ll do better next time and I never do. I said I was gonna get started on my history essay early. I literally did it three hours before it was due and turned it in by a miracle at exactly 11:59. I did only one part of the two part midterm. All my teachers have stressed not to do this yet I never seem to care. 

I need to pass these classes I want pass these classes. I just can’t get myself to actually work for it. I’m half way through the semester I still have time to get better I want to get better but it just feels like I should give up here and say fuck it. 

However this isn’t high-school anymore. While it may not be the end all be all and I can still retake classes it’s still so frustrating. I want to get out of this loop and actually set a routine feel like I’m actually doing something with my life.

I decided to turn to this community about this problem I currently have. So I'm in a class that had a test last Friday, I got a good grade on it (only the test grade was posted online), today was the day that the tests would physically be given back, however, I overslept today, and missed it. In scenarios like this, I would usually email the professor and ask what to do, however, I've already emailed him once about missing class last week, and over the weekend I emailed him regarding a question from the test. Therefore, I'm nervous about emailing him again to ask about this, even though he's a genuinely nice professor but I'm hesitating to do this. 

The class takes place on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, but there will be no class this Friday, then next week is our college's spring break, and that following Monday, after spring break, there will be no class again, so I'm not very sure how to approach this. What should I do? I'd love to give anyone any additional information if necessary, thank you.",1,1,BrunetCon2002
33,tai8uw,2022-03-09 21:35:19,CollegeRant,Rant: Anyone Regret Their Major?,"Hi all,

Hope you're all well. The anonymity of the Internet is a great thing I suppose, so I will rant here perhaps in the hopes of finding people who relate somehow.

I originally wanted to major in art and I had very ambitious dreams of working for Disney. Art has always been my passion for as long as I could pick up a pencil. I even took high school art class and my teacher recommended me to advanced art because she believed in me.

Fast forward to community college, I started falling out of love with the idea of being an art major. For a field that's so rounded in subjectivity, I faced some real challenges in getting good grades and even recognition from other classmates. It was really discouraging. While I started falling in love with psychology, thanks to having perhaps one of the best professors I will ever have. Plus art supplies really added up financially. So it was then that I switched majors. 

However, these days I've been dealing with a lot of regret in this decision. I've been having a lot of hardship in my new university (transferring from another university due to moving to another state); they make it so hard for online students to get the classes they need to graduate. I have to take some gen ed Biology class that for some odd reason they don't offer often online so I have to be a Transient student elsewhere. On top of that, because I need to be a resident for a year, I'm paying out of state tuition despite having permanent residence. I've just been falling out of love with psychology because of the difficulties surrounding this major. The fun out of psychology has been demolished thanks to all of these difficulties surrounding my major program.

I'm not even planning on grad school. I just want a degree at this point and finish this long as heck career. I feel that perhaps if I stayed in art, I would've been somebody. I'm not trying to brag but I have potential, and I wasted it by quitting art academically. I wouldn't be going through these college bureaucratic red tapes for a class that's not even remotely related to my major at all.

I'm just tired. I feel like I'm just in this endless rut with everything against me, on top of my dad having cancer. I don't know what I even want anymore and I'm frustrated and some days I just don't want to get out of bed and just cry all day. I've been fortunate enough that my dad has supported me financially and emotionally and I'm scared that it's all in vain.",1,1,Legendary_Narwhal07

It’s fully online which was a bad decision on my part, but I remember doing great in trig in high school so I thought I could do it. There’s no recorded lectures, the teacher just posts a couple problems walked through and then there’s a couple more example videos in the online textbook. The textbook has to be the worst math textbook I’ve ever used. Anyway, I’m not sure I can pass this class.

Last time I went to advising, I got yelled at for scheduling my meeting a day before scheduling, which yes, I was in the wrong for. I wasn’t treating my ADHD so I was a disorganized mess, and anxiety is a bitch. But then the advising SNAPPED AT ME WHEN I WAS THE ONE WHO HAD TO WAIT FOR 3 HOURS AS SHE WAS SWAMPED WITH MEETINGS. FOR A MEETING THAT TOOK MAYBE 5-10 minutes. Who my advisor was was constantly unclear, it was changed on me during my Freshman year, and they’ve constantly scheduled meetings only to not show up (I admit, that last one I’ve been fortunate to avoid, but it was because I stopped going after that experience.). 
And with COVID. I get it, teaching online is hard, but the teacher I had EXCLUSIVELY TAUGHT ONLINE EVEN BEFORE COVID. And I had to go to my dean of students and demand a passing grade due to the fact that my teacher took a MONTH to grade assignments, leading me to believe up until the final week of the quarter, that I had an A-. And when did she grade all the assignments? THE DAY AFTER THE QUARTER ENDED. WHEN I CAN’T DO ANYTHING. I went from an A- to a D- IN A DAY. Thankfully, that got fixed, but that class held me back in my other classes as not having the digital foundations that class promised held me back in the classes that required those digital foundations to succeed. I have to pay for parking if I don’t want my car broken into by homeless people because their design building is downtown, and even with the student discount, I’d have to pay $250 PER QUARTER FOR A PARKING PASS. SO GLAD THEY CARE ABOUT EQUALITY AND DIVERSITY, BUT NOT ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THOSE DIVERSE STUDENTS UNLESS THEY PAY THEM MORE FOR THE SCHOOL THEY’RE ALREADY GOING INTO DEBT FOR.
And now, today, I found out, during my senior year, in my winter quarter, that I may need to take ANOTHER YEAR TO GRADUATE. They were kind enough to give me an alert that I was doing poorly in a class…but not until I was a senior. Not throughout all the other quarters. So they won’t reach out to me, or they won’t, “come looking for me to see if I’m struggling,” until they do. And even better, they changed the requirements needed for my degree, so a class that I’ve been trying to get into for a YEAR, now isn’t required. Despite their website listing it as a requirement. And trying to apply to graduate for the degree program itself? Searching it by name offers no results…FUCK THIS SHIT.

I have a bone to pick with my university. Out of respect for them I will not name them since I haven’t given them the chance to fix the issues yet. I go to a well known University and they have the capabilities to run a decent online program. However, the teachers who are assigned to these online classes simply aren’t doing their jobs. It seems like all they do is play Russian Roulette with LMS platforms such as Pearson, McGraw Hill Connect, or Cengage and then pick a book that seems good enough for their class and let it “go with the flow”. There’s no actual teaching involved. PowerPoints come straight from the publisher, videos from other professors are used and not explained better by the actual professor teaching the specific section, and emails go unanswered for so long that you basically have a zero on a pending assignment waiting to be turned in before you can receive assistance from the professor. Online students pay the same amount for a class that an in person student pays and the in person student gets a better experience simply because the professor has no choice but to interact with the students. It seems like the online professors are pretty much hands off with their teaching approach and it’s completely unfair.

It's 1 am right now and I've been trying to fall asleep since 10. I'm just so stressed out I literally can't sleep. I just took three midterms, and only one of them went well. I failed economics, but then I found out that the class average for the test was failing, and that it'd been that way for years. Honestly why the fuck is that even allowed? They're saying it's no big deal, but my transcript doesn't care if the whole class failed too. Another one of my classes is taught by an older guy who seems cool, but I just got a grade of 0/100 back that I know has to be a mistake. A mistake that gave me a fucking heart attack that I now have to straighten out while studying for my fourth midterm. At least my first test went well....

Just for some background, school doesn't come easy to me. Unfortunately my ADHD makes it nearly impossible to focus on my coursework because frankly it's boring as hell and I don't like it. I need to spend hours trying to focus in order to do what a normal person could handle in an hour. I haven't gone to a party or a concert, or any fun event this entire semester, unlike my classmates who seem to be out every night. I haven't been able to make friends since I'm so focused on not failing, and honestly I'm so stressed and irritated all the time that I'm probably not giving off the best vibes. 

For some reason, it was way easier for me before COVID. I was able to pull good grades while having a social life, but ever since I came back that wasn't the case. I worked as a Firefighter/EMT when I was home instead of doing class full time, so that may be part of it. I also ended up switching majors the year I got back since I realized that I'm much more interested in IT than what I was doing before, but I need to take a bunch of general business classes before I can get to the good stuff. 

Because of everything, I'm in a stress cycle that I don't see a way out of. I get work assigned from classes that I can't focus on even though I try, then I stay up either because I'm stressed about not being able to do it or because I get a random burst of energy that allows me to finally get the work done at some ungodly hour. Then I'm tired because I don't sleep, and stressed because I don't really get the material (since half of it is delivered online through video lectures even though we're supposedly in person). And the cycle continues.....

I've tried all of the basic tips. I'm in therapy with a school psychologist, I try my hardest to make to-do lists and set timers and all of that stuff. Sometimes it works, but it's honestly a coin toss. Over the course of the semester, I've just gotten worse. I just feel so burnt out it hurts.

I have nothing but respect for this guy, I have never ever once disrespected him or said anything out of line. On the contrary, I made sure to let him know how much I appreciated all his help last semester. Here's where my paranoia kicks in.

There was a girl in my class who looked pretty identical to me. So much so that the students often mistook us for each other. The problem is, she was so rude and very rude to the professor. She called him incompetent to his face, constantly insulted him, and the stupidest part is she behaved this way because she had a raging crush on him and was so immature as to handle this crush like a middle schooler by being mean to him. 

Our class had over 100 students so my professor did not know us on a first name basis. Pretty sure he went the whole semester without knowing my name. Well one day he tells me to stay after class which I found odd since we never really interacted, but I did. He then starts grilling me and asks me why I was being so rude and I was the most confused I had ever been. I think we both realized at the same time, I was not the girl he thought I was and he profusely started apologizing and we laughed it off. Alright, thats over with, but still, he did not know my name or hers. Semester ends and everything was alright until right about now.

I email my professor a few times asking him to help me with an extra project and he agrees. We email a few times and he responds within a few hours to a day each time. Keep in mind these interactions are happening strictly over email, he addresses my name but does not have a face to put to the name at this point. A couple weeks later I happened to add a profile picture to my email for professional reasons, and while I cannot say that this is a direct result of this action, of course my anxiety ridden brain happened to jump to it immediately. I emailed him two weeks ago about the project, no response. Okay cool, maybe he's busy? I email him again a week later, no response. Hmm starting to become suspicious. Emailed him again last night after he had responded a friend of mine, so I knew he was online, no response again. This project was for one of the programs I am in and I needed his signature on a form by a certain deadline which has now passed and it kind of really screwed me over.

While I am crushed about the missed deadline, it is bothering me more that he is blatantly ignoring me. I can't say for certain my pfp is the cause of his alleged ""feelings"" toward me, but I feel that there is no other explanation. I know my emails are not going to his spam because we had emailed each other countless times beforehand. I know he is online because he responded to my friend who sent him an email at the same time as me. I just feel so crushed and hurt honestly, I am not sure what to do?

48,szv84y,2022-02-23 23:23:04,CollegeRant,Only 1 submission attempt and submitted the wrong assignment before the due date :(,"I recently had 2 assignments from the same class due on the same day as one of the due dates were extended to the same date. I ended up submitting the same assignment (the names were like Assign 2 and Assign 3) for both accidentally since the window was so small. The instructor only allows 1 attempt for each submission so even though I submitted before the due date, I couldn't resubmit it. I sent an email to the TA immediately with the right assignment attached but got a response back that it was my responsibility to double-check the submission, so I'll be getting a 0. :( Normally this never happens but I guess the two assignments due on the same date and me misreading resulted in that. I sent an email to the instructor asking if it would be possible to get an exception but I completely understand that it's my fault and if he doesn't accept it. Fingers crossed that he'll be lenient but things are not looking good :( I was planning to just take the 0 but I read online that it is better to try to email than not. 

I'm the type of person who gets extremely anxious about my grades and will submit assignments multiple times to make sure I have no mistakes. The fact that the instructor only allows 1 attempt for each submission (pdf submissions) gave me a lot of stress since the beginning of the semester haha. I even wake up in the middle of the night to check my assignments or have nightmares about doing badly on tests. So this just kind of sucks to get a 0 and make a mistake which normally I try so hard to not do.

55,swdehk,2022-02-19 16:08:46,CollegeRant,Can you survive college and beyond with no friends?,"My first year has pretty much sucked, and this is NOT because of Covid. Infact, we had a good number of months offline because ours is a medical college (fewer restrictions, hospitals were operating all-time). It’s the social equation that has been troubling me since.

I’m writing this post in a severely frustrated state, so I apologise if reading this isn‘t worth the time. It is just me venting out, and I hope I’m civil when I do this.

\-start of rant-

As an ordinary teenager, I assumed that once NEET was done and dusted, I would meet people who would be like me— similar mindset, similar goals, similar hobbies; my life would be “fun”. As someone who grew up in a school where no one, I want to emphasise— no one was interested in the same stuff I was into (where I was shunned for being a nerd), I hoped for a change. The popular kids would make me their “friend” to help with class notes and holiday homeworks, the coaching kids hated me because they thought life was a competition. I had only one friend throughout four years who isn’t talking to me now. (I guess they got a little mad at me for a better-than-average neet score, and when I shifted to a new city, we lost touch completely.) Basically, school+ the 2 years of coaching were pathetic.

But college is far from what I dreamt it would be. The blogs that said “college was the best part of my life”, the fun firsts that people experience, the videos of people enjoying; the friendships that last a lifetime: where is all that?

My roommates are instagram gossip experts, and I hate them. I did well academically last term, but I never got the satisfaction I was looking for. I spent the first four months siting in a different seat in the lecture theatre trying to talk to new people and make friends, but none of that fucking lasted. Once the lockdown eased a bit and we got back, I saw groups were already formed and I wasn’t going to fit in anywhere. No one is interested in art, literature, history of medicine or non fiction books. Even if they are, all they do is gossip. That’s how friendships form in a medical college, I learnt.

Mine is not a great college, it is an average government med college in a tier-one city. We don’t have societies, clubs or even a well funded library. We do have a student council, but it is full of the famous kids and is highly political, so I avoid that.

I did not go out for any trips, did not make any good friends, did not enjoy the social liberty I thought I would get. I *did* put myself out there-- performed in a skit in front of the class (even though I don‘t know the ABCs of acting), started an instagram art page (which was well appreciated), started reciting poems and took part in competitions (even though I suck at it), and tried to get out of my comfort zone.

Every time I met a new person, I would ask them about *their* life, *their* likes, *their* school, *their* hobbies. I downplayed myself everywhere, was more modest than ever. I followed the book (How to make friends and influence people) religiously. I would also be kind and chatty to the reserved category kids who did not mingle with the other kids and had a separate group of their own. What the fuck did I do wrong?

When the friend-making mission at college failed, I tried to find online ones. But they didn’t last. I joined an online art club, and that ended with a guy stalking me for four months using different numbers and sending inappropriate texts. I am never going to do that again.

Cue to now, all I see on Instagram (which I login once every six months) are people having Goa-trips, late-night memorable stories, romantic dates, weird filter photographs, having the IDEAL college life that I struggled to earn.

Am I alone here?

I know that post grad is going to be hell, with all the 24-hour work duties and more research, heavier academics. I don’t think I will ever have the F.R.IENDS’s life (can someone make a TV show about real-life crisis that don’t involve dating and relationships?). I have a fixed death date, and I don’t see anything getting better by then.

\-end of rant-

I want to know, **is there a scope of growing up to be a functional adult when my college years pass out like this?**

I’ve been off and on school for about five years. I’m ready to get on with life and feel like I have the know how of doing it - both professionally and otherwise. However I have up to two years of school left. 

Insert Tyra banks I am disgusted gif 

The thought of having to become a student again kind of sickens me. 

Backstory: moved to the east coast for college. Did two years. Discovered I liked art. Moved back home and took a gap semester to build art portfolio so I could transfer. Studied abroad (cut short by Covid) where I did my first independent self guided projects - legit didn’t have a weekly class. There I really started to learn self discipline in learning and creating as an artist.

Got into the art school I wanted. Transferred. Was online for a whole year (where i learned self-discipline and creativity even more) My third semester, went back in person part time as a commuter student while juggling an internship - when I realized I did not have enough money to live on campus. I remember at the end of the semester sitting in the bar where I was supposed to be celebrating the screening of a film I had worked on the whole semester for class and just feeling - numb. Glad it was finally over (for a second)

 I’m taking a semester off again to take a breathe, work on my own art projects again, and find that love for art again.  (Legit feels like the first time in my life I have time to just ponder things and focus on my social life.)

The main thing I noticed in my academic journey that started back in 2017 is - I’ve gotten really good at teaching myself. If I don’t understand something I know how to create a plan to understand it and find people who can support me in that journey. I haven’t immersed myself in the SOCIAL community of my new school in the same way I did for my first college - and since I’m so close to home (an hour) I don’t feel a need to. (I am on the executive board of a student club, and participate virtually - and currently do research with grad students - and attend virtual seminars that sound interesting when I can)

So I’m like - I know how to learn - I don’t really want to put energy into being a part of this community. What am I doing besides completing a degree?

This thought occurred to me as I’m reading this anthropology paper and I’m so excited by what I’m learning - and this isn’t assigned reading and would have never been assigned in any of my classes. 

I don’t want to pretend. I don’t want to do shit I don’t want to do (and be around people constantly lamenting about doing shit they don’t want to do)

I just feel so close to being the artist I want to be - going to school feels like a break from having the time and space to do that. 

Im working with my advisor to figure out how much time I have left and it’s looking like 1.5-2 years realistically (if I go full time which would mean living on campus)

I mean the thought of partying and dicking around again seems fun - and just doing college type shit I missed out on (and having the money to do it now) but….

I want a residency by the end of this year - not be in a required writing class. 

What do y’all think I’m missing? What am I not getting? What can I look forward to?

Right now I’m thinking having as much life outside of the college as possible will help - ion know tho.",3,1,CharlesBurray

Even though some teachers are obviously new to canvas, usually they can communicate well on how they want things done and it’s very simple. Now in my final semester my hardest class, and art history class, I have a teacher who is absolutely not capable of teaching online. It has only been 2 days since the class has been opened but I’m already overwhelmed and confused. Everything is out of date (ex: the syllabus says “spring 2021” but then everything in the syllabus refers to the fall semester.

I’m going to give it my all to try and pass before the semester is up but I’m already behind and if I don’t succeed I’m afraid I may have to drop out.  

I hate college.  I can see why some people like it but for me I hate it.  I find my classes a waste of time, I have no friends, don’t get with any girls or have a gf, make no money, have no fun.  I’m exhausted.     

I probably should have listened to my body and brain my freshman year when I failed the same class back to back.  Ever since then I have had to take extra classes playing catch up even though I got As and a few Bs in my other classes.  This is especially because I haven’t been able to take 5 classes a semester at my previous community college and I never dual enrolled.

My dad ended up coasting through college and ended up getting a good/decent income (lower 6 digits) for a few years so my parents didn’t believe in stressing me out for school and never ask me for my homework or push me to well.  I’ve had to rely on self motivation and I’m not saying their wrong or I’m wrong but it’s just the situation and to be honest I’ve just been so burnt out.  Everything feels like there’s a wall in front of doing the simplest tasks. I am tired of working and making no money by taking pointless classes.  

I feel uninspired and purposeless and I have made no friends bc I took a lonely college route that broke me up from my local good friends (all the others ones are gone somewhere else in the state) I’m behind on graduating due to the reasons I stated earlier and I’ve heard “just go out and make more friends, or go out and have a good time sometime and maybe it would refresh you”. I would like to agree but honestly that’s just so scary to me.  Not because of social anxiety but because I am already failing classes once again and I’m worried if I go out and try to have fun at least once a week I’ll get left behind even worse.  

I’m a senior and I don’t know what to do because already I will have to do my graduating semester in fall online because my family cannot afford  rent for my last semester of college and I only have a few classes left for my major (4).   I literally do nothing outside of school but work out 3-5 times a week, play with my dog here and there, and study.  

TLDR;  I’m so stuck and I feel like I’ve let everyone down.  I feel like my parents wouldn’t have cared if I just took a gap semester but I was too stubborn and now I feel like it’s paying the price via burnout and currently dialing my classes. There’s still a “decent” chance that I will pass but idk……",5,1,Several_Second7704
59,stp8hj,2022-02-16 06:41:18,CollegeRant,Students can be Spoiled,"I'm a junior at a tech school in a stem major.
I go to a school that held a full year online over the fall of 2020 and spring of 2021 like most school. And then came back to campus at full capacity in person for fall 2021. Now with that, some classes were hybrid online to combat covid fears. As well as some classes holding tests online to avoid everyone cramming into one room because many people were using the hybrid option and general missing students.
This has lead to a big problem of everyone wanting tests and quizzes to be held online. So that people don't have to go to campus (most people live off campus because we are a city school), and because people would like the option of openly cheating with out professors in the room to check on them.
Today I had an economics class that announced a quiz that would take place over a week from today. And the first question after the announcement was do we have to attend class. The answer was yes. The test would be held on canvas, but you must be present in class for it to be okay. This class is held in the biggest lecture hall on campus and doesn't even have enough students to fill it. And people complained that it was a covid issue even though people attended class in the same room. And then they complained that there wasn't enough room on the desk pull outs for a not book and laptop. Even though they could easily put a note book for scratch paper on their laps. Then they said their wasn't enough time for the quiz. The quiz is 13 questions total with 9 MC and 4 single calculation short answer with a formula sheet and references available, and open book and open notes. And the quiz is 30 minutes. I've been given much denser assessment in harder subjects and done relatively fine. This seemed like a highschool level complaint to me. Then the most spoiled complaint that was made by several people was that we would not upload any work that we wrote out. Only submitting our final answers for the short answer portion which would be a single number for a single calculation. This was a complaint because they asked how they could get partial credit. It's a single equation that you'll be given the numbers for. If you screw that up then that's your own problem. That are not at all required to give partial credit like other classes do. 
In short this whole rant was to say that I feel like college students are spoiled from recent events and trends in schools and classes and it just makes me angry.

Now, almost everyone's schools allows in-school classes and they seem to be going, but also, pretty soon, due to scheduling issues and only one car in the house, I'll be taking all my classes at home, and due to the same issue, can't get a job to get my own car and all, so for the current moment, I'm trapped at home for classes, and I really wanted to meet new people, just have the college experience, you know? But now I won't for this semester, maybe longer. It's good cuz less gas wasted, and I'm in group chats with each of my classes so I'm not completely alone, but just wanna see if anyone else has this almost guilty/trapped feeling taking classes at home when plenty of people are at school taking them (with precautions, obviously). It just seems that I'm left behind and they're ahead in life because of it. It's my first year/semester, in case that helps explain or something, who knows.

I had great  study habits and got all As throughout the year. It's now second  semester of my junior year, and in Mechanical Engineering, this is  notoriously the hardest semester at my school.

Enter  Heat and Mass Transfer. From the first day of the class, I knew from  the way my professor was teaching, the fact that I couldn't make his  office hours, and how hard the homeworks were, that this class was going  to eat a lot of my time. Also, this class had 6 exams, with no final.

Well,  last Monday, we had our first exam, only on really 3 chapters of the  textbook, and it went horrible. Like proper bad for me, I froze up for  30 minutes, I didn't know how to generate answers for half the exam.  He's already released the solution and I saw everywhere I went wrong,  even though it was pretty obvious from the moment I walked out of the  room.

I know exactly why I failed  though, in contrast with every other class I've been in, I really didn't spend much time studying. I really didn't take the time to redo  problems nor figure out what calculator functions I may need (this one  got me good). But, and this is a big one, my professor was bad at  teaching. For a 3000 level engineering class, you'd really expect him to  not read verbatim off the slides and barely write derivations out. We  had only done one example leading up to the first exam, over 3 weeks of  class. Was it my fault for failing? Definitely, I could've spent more  time reading the textbook or watching YouTube videos on the topic. Is it  only my fault for failing? Not really, while I do believe some level of  teaching yourself is required for any topic, I'm not going to spend 3  hours after class trying to parse out what my professor mumbled about  for 50 minutes. I'm out here paying tuition to learn, and the level of  teaching I received was high school biology level.

My  solution? I dropped the class, it's offered in the summer, online, and  with a different professor. It doesn't affect my graduation nor do I  mind paying a little extra to lighten my work load. Hope y'all don't  mind the vent here, there's no real lesson here because I haven't felt  the consequences of my decision quite yet.",2,1,geNe1r

64,sojxpe,2022-02-09 18:09:49,CollegeRant,Debt to Income ratio panic,"Alright, venting for a sec here re: college costs and debt to income ratios:

Imagine you're a Grad student with a 4.0 GPA. Your degree is specifically designed to be executed while you work a full time job in tandem with it, and all of your classes are asynchronous and remotely accessed online. 

Every time you go to class for a single hour, imagine you have you swipe your debit card for USD$75.42 for that hour you're in class.

BUT you have 6 hours of class per week, so every week, you swipe your debit card for $452.50. 

Your semesters are 18-weeks long, so you pay $452.50 per week 18 times over the course of a little over 4 months totaling $8,145 over the course of nine (9), bi-weekly pay cycles (meaning $900 every pay check). Oh, and by the way, you can't actually pay it weekly, and if you can't pay it in one massive chunk at one time, you have to pay an extra $225 to break it into payment installments for you. 

Because your degree is asynchronous, your opportunity for work study is limited, and because you're working full-time (to coexist with the degree format), you make too much to qualify for financial aid that isn't just a loan. 

This is literally what American collegiate students in undergrad and grad (like me, a 27F fourth-semester ""MS Eng, Tech, and Mgmt"" student) are experiencing right now. My expected yearly contribution to my Grad degree is $16,290 (which how did that number come about, I do not have an extra $1000+ per month just ""free"" for school spending, and I already work as a systems engineer). 

I'm now stuck between choosing to further raise my debt to income ratio by taking out graduate loans in addition to my already existing undergrad loans (which I've paid down consistently since I graduated and still have over $20k left) or giving up the degree entirely because I can't pay for it alone and scholarships aren't available to me, despite the 3-semester 4.0 streak. 

I probably sound ridiculous, but I'm really fretting over this. I love this degree. I *want* to finish it. But how can I financially justify taking on even more debt than I already have when whatever job the degree might win me may not even pay the dividends on my original investment (via loaned money) in the knowledge? Who the hell has an extra $450 per week right now? 

And, don't worry team, already nixxed the avocado toast and Starbucks 🙃 If I get rid of all my TV/movie subscriptions that'll free up another ~$12 per week, so now I only need to figure out where the remaining $445 someodd is coming from each week 🥴

All jokes and sass aside, any advice would be really helpful. I'm at a loss here. Has anyone used outside reliable scholarship programs before? Or know of ways to offset the cost of school without access to scholarships/grants/financial aid that isn't loans? I don't know what the smart move is here...I don't know whether to quit and not dump money into an investment that won't pay off or to bite the financial bullet and skyrocket my debt to income ratio even more...

65,soit8x,2022-02-09 17:21:23,CollegeRant,I think I’ve hit my breaking point.,"Here’s a rant.

Last semester I was a great student and overcame two shitty teachers with hardcore studying, dediation, and brute force. I was on top of everything and kept my shit together.

This semester I’ve been barely hanging on and only doing the bare minimum to get by. I’m not learning. I’m just trying to keep my shit together for a grade. And even then, I’m barely doing that. I study maybe twice a week for 3 hours at a time. Then I procrastinate and shove the bulk of my work to the weekend, mainly Sunday, and spend 12+ hours fighting to get everything done. Then I’m even more burnt out and it perpetuates the cycle. I’m so behind in studying now and it’s only getting worse and worse and I don’t know how to fucking catch up again.

I’m scared since I’m not learning important concepts in chemistry and microbiology, which are integral to my degree, and I’m just writing shit down and trying to remember it long enough to take a test. I keep picturing myself at my dream job to try motivating myself, but I only imagine myself being a dumbass and not knowing what to do.

Another issue though is that I can’t study at home. The moment I walk in my door, I lose all physical and mental capabilities of studying or doing homework. I’m fucking tired and going home and feeling the stress and fear melting away is indescribable. I need to study on campus. But I’m always fucking nervous at school unless I reserve a private study room in the library (where the max time is 3 hours, which is nowhere near enough time to get any meaningful work done in my current situation of needing to catch up with a *lot* of shit).

Admittedly, I had a drinking problem last semester to cope with stress. I kicked the habit over winter break when I had time to breathe and relax normally, and the addiction was gone in a matter of *days* after finals. I have a hard time letting go in my down-time, so alcohol is my key to successfully relaxing. I hate to say this, but I think the alcohol helped me a *lot* in this regard. It was one of my best tools, even if I did go to class hungover more than I want to admit. At least I still got shit done more than I do now. And I’m so tempted to go get my shitty $12 bottle of 50% abv vodka on my way home today. If I can maximize my relaxation, I can recover more after each day and maximize my performance at school. I’m so fucking tempted.

I would LOVE to go to therapy. I’ve had shitty, somewhat traumatizing experiences with therapists in the past but the one I had before I moved was a lifechanging angel. I need therapy again. But my anxiety is so bad that I need a Xanax to make phone calls and then need to take the rest of my day off to mentally reset and calm down. I’m so fucking mad at myself for this too. I see a psychiatrist every 3 months for my meds and she keeps putting in referrals for me, but I never get any calls back.

I keep telling myself that “I just don’t have enough time in the day” when I absolutely fucking do, I have only one morning-midday class every M-Th, and then weekends free (my two other classes are online). I don’t have a job. I have *no* fucking excuse to not be taking advantage of all the time I have and the resources I have. But I just go home around 2pm and play fucking Overwatch (I don’t even like OW anymore???) and stuff my face and suddenly it’s 9pm.

When it all comes down to it, I’m just not fucking trying hard enough and I *know* this, yet I don’t get off my ass and push myself to do anything about it. I just sit here, tired, angry, and hating myself. I have 100% control over my academic performance and learning and control over seeking help. I have control to clean my house and at least start meal prepping healthy food, I have the power to make all the positive changes in my life but I’m just not fucking doing it. I’m great at making plans to do shit, but the *doing* part is what gets me.

I don’t know what the fuck to do anymore.",7,1,concerninglydumb

He either is completely incompetent or just lazy. His syllabus makes absolutely no sense for either class he’s teaching. None of the point breakdowns actually correspond to the assignments in the class. A 4 page paper was worth *less* points than a 5 minute McGraw Hill assignment. Since it appears he hasn’t changed point totals there are 6,500 points available in a class he claims only has 1,000 available. No due dates are posted except for every single test being due on the day after the last day of class. He changed the date of the final last semester to the day he changed it, sending out an email saying whoops I had the final listed on the wrong day it’s due today good luck fuckers. The final may I add was a Microsoft Word document where I was suppose to highlight the answers and submit it back to him, as opposed to a automatically graded test on canvas or even the testing lab on campus.

I have sent him several emails asking for clarification and he either doesn’t respond or he only responds to one question. I understand I’m going to community college I shouldn’t expect much but goddamn this guy just does not give a shit about his students.

This is my first semester taking one of them, it’s a lean economics class with an online version and a hybrid version. I registered for the online version, which is listed on the syllabus as being asynchronous and having no official class meetings.

So then why do I get an email from my professor asking if I’m going to come to Monday lectures?? Apparently I have missed 3 lectures for this class, which would have been really helpful to know about because it feels like I’m drowning trying to keep up with the content. I just don’t understand what happened because the syllabus definitely says we have no meetings. Also it’s an 8 week class so I missed almost half of it

70,sk3uzx,2022-02-04 04:12:38,CollegeRant,Lots of questions. Not sure what do at this point... associates degree but not car or job,"I'm a transfer student. I recently transferred over to my state college this fall.

My timeline is as follows:4 years spent in a CC  2018-2021 (Obtained associates... in liberal arts)

Recent transfer (state school) Fall 2021 to present. I'm 21.

**So this is what I need help with:**

I chose a school that is like 2+ hours away and I don't drive, I've been here for 2 semesters total. While I foresee myself taking majority online courses, there are still some I want to take it person. I ended up dropping a language course that was for my MINOR because I really was not meshing well with the professor or their teaching style, it was very conflicting for me. The thing is, that class was the only online option and now I don't know what to do, as I am (on paper) only a 'part-time' student with this class gone. There is one offered in person, but classes are well into session (second week of instruction) &amp; this would not be very practical with public transit. Say a class is from 11:00 - 11:50 A.M, I would be leaving the house at 8 am and coming home at around 5pm. Not ideal... So because of this, I am rethinking my school. I didn't want to go to my local state school because I didn't want to run into the people I knew. I also just wanted to spread out. I am actually rethinking going to college as a whole.

As it turns out, I am not easily able to attend college without something coming up or bothering me. It always feels like I try my best and I'm met with things that make it more difficult for me. I admit part of the problem is that I am emotional and sensitive but I don't know how to remove that from myself. It protects me. I can predict how things will turn out (FOR ME)  by being this way and using that sense.

I'm really at a loss of what to do, because I only really qualify for state schools, and they are all apart from each other. Also the CSU applications open around winter so...not sure what to do. Would have to wait until next winter or what. Because I spent so long in community college, I've gone past the limit of transferable units/credits so I can't take a course in a community college. There are many academic-based things I am super interested in doing, like studying abroad but even that seems like a huge challenge given what I just mentioned above.

Should I drop out all together? It feels like I'm going nowhere. Would love to hear suggestions.",1,1,Gazeoph

75,si4glf,2022-02-01 20:18:13,CollegeRant,I'm sick and tired of teachers who make their online courses asynchronous and put in no effort themselves to engage the class with the learning material. To me it just feels like an excuse to not actually teach.,"This has been an ongoing issue since I started college again the first fall semester after lockdowns began. Certain classes, always in the humanities/social sciences/non-STEM classes, have been entirely asynchronous, which basically means there are no set meeting times and the students are solely responsible for teaching themselves the coursework either by reading the book, or reviewing lecture slides, etc. The teacher basically does nothing but grade assignments and hold office hours to answer questions. I understand that there are just some classes that can't be done very well online, like classes with a lab section or with a very hands on component. But if this is a class that normally involves regular class meetings where it's just the teacher giving a lecture while the students take notes I just don't see any excuse to not do the same online. All of my STEM professors managed to make the transition and even the science classes that had a lab component tried to make due. My biology lab last semester wasn't the greatest, but at least the teacher was still holding a zoom meeting and walking us through what the experiment would be like if we were actually there to do it ourselves, our professor actually just used the opportunity to give a secondary lecture on the materials she would've been explaining in the lab and then switching over to videos of the experiment being performed where the information of the lecture was relevant. But almost every single one of my history, humanities, sociology, etc. classes have been asynchronous and to me it just reeks of laziness.

This finally came to a head today when I was preparing to meet for my Humanities 101 course, which up until a few weeks ago was planned to be held face-to-face until the college decided to go back online for the first few weeks of the semester due to Omicron. We have scheduled class meetings, but instead of just doing the lectures that she would have been doing were it not for the sudden temporary switch back to online, she decided to make it asynchronous and push the responsibility on us to keep up with the course work until we go back in person and she'll resume the standard lecture format. Why?! What actual reason is there to not  take the time to meet with students and give a lecture online when you would have been doing that anyway in person? A few semesters ago I had a history class where the teacher used the same syllabus for online that he would've for in-person classes, which included grading rubric for writing assignments, homework, quizzes and exams. So for the first week I was panicking as I searched all over the Canvas page for where homework was listed, because the syllabus indicated there was a homework assignment for the first week. There was no information anywhere on what the assignment was or where to submit it, come to find out that the entire course was basically just going to be read the given chapters by a given date and then take the exam. At that point it's not even teaching, Canvas grades the exams automatically unless there are short answer or essay style questions. But instead of actually teaching, the teacher basically fucked off and left it all on us to learn the material.

I'm all for holding students accountable for their education, and if they can't put in the work required to learn the material then they shouldn't pass the class. And I get that teaching isn't easy and a lot of professors are just there to research and teaching is a requirement by the college or university. But at the same time if I'm paying to have someone teach a class, I expect them to actually TEACH THE CLASS! It's one thing if you have a personal matter to deal with that prevents you from teaching a few classes and you need the students to keep up with the work that you would've been teaching otherwise so they aren't lost when you resume regular lectures. But if your only reason for not actually holding a class meeting is because it's online and you can get away with it, how can I think it's anything other than laziness?

It really just seems like these teachers are completely unwilling to put in the effort to adjust to online learning and so they just don't bother and push the burden on the students. This isn't what I paid for.

Anyone else have these kinds of issues with online classes?

TL;DR Teachers who would normally hold regular classes and give lectures, but refuse to do so for online classes reek of laziness. If your regular classes boil down to a lecture while students take notes and ask questions, there's really no reason why you can't set aside time to hold those same lectures over video-conferencing. Or at least put in the effort to make your asynchronous course engaging instead of just making the students read the textbook, do a homework assignment, and take an exam.

And just as a clarification, I'm not talking about teachers who actually go the extra mile to make asynchronous classes engaging and work for the medium involved. I had a music class last semester that was great. The teacher posted all lectures as videos, held regular office hours to answer any questions students might have, had discussion posts as part of the required work so students could engage with what they've learned with other students, had several writing assignments throughout the semester including a final research paper, and quizzes and exams in the middle and at the end of each module. That isn't the kind of professor I'm talking about, because he did what he could to still give lectures. I'm talking about the teachers who would normally give regular lectures during a normal school year whose online courses boil down to: ""Here are my lecture slides, read these chapters, and take the exam. Good luck on the final.""",1,1,Danni293

77,sh842m,2022-01-31 18:22:50,CollegeRant,Cengage is killing me (long),"I'm currently taking an online multivariable calculus course through Cengage and it's criminally awful. It's making my hair fall out from stress.To be clear, the concepts are not terribly difficult. This is mostly all math I've done before, there's just a bit more of it. It's still one of the most challenging classes I've ever taken though. 

The questions are written in such an insane way that I sometimes can't even parse what they want me to do. They will write using double negatives just to confuse you, for example. If I wanted to make a 7-year-old think I was really smart, I would write like Cengage does. The walkthroughs on the homework are rarely helpful either; sometimes they even seem to confuse the dot and cross products. 

The PowerPoints that we use for Zoom lectures are insipid. They ramble for dozens of slides without saying anything, let alone making it clear what your formulas are and how you're expected to solve problems. On top of that, the homework assignments never match up to what's covered in the PowerPoints. There's always some type of complication that it never prepares you for. If I had to guess, I would say almost half of all of the questions are ""bully problems."" You know, the ones that are designed to trick you. Even the ones that are straightforward will jump back and forth between expecting a vector and carrots and a vector and components. What's used in the setup and the walkthrough has no correlation to what answer it wants. And then it marks your correct answer wrong because it doesn't automatically bold I, j, and k for a component vector.

The teacher is down in the trenches with us too. They seem really kind and understanding, but unprepared for the material of this class. They'll go through some of the homework in lecture, just to try and catch any syntax of phrasing difficulties we may find. In the last lecture, the teacher tried to walk through one of the questions and it took 25 minutes. They couldn't get it right. We even got a heads-up that there are online calculators that can just deal with these poorly designed problems. 

This class is so disjointed and confusing, I half believe Cengage pirated it piece by piece from other, slightly less shameful corporate education companies. I can't think of any other explanation for how someone would decide that this is a functioning product. And somehow, it's still not as bad as the calculus 2 course I also took from Cengage. 

The only thing that's keeping me from having an aneurysm from the stress is that I have a transfer application in and this might be a lame duck class. I don't mean that hyperbolically, either. I feel ill whenever I have to do anything with this class, I barely sleep at night anymore, and it makes me feel like I'm stupid and do not belong.

I'm trying my best, and I have to keep reminding myself that that's enough. Anyway, thanks for reading.

Just one of my classes is in person and that makes me so stressed and unhappy I guess, the professor is great but I hate that I have to rely on my parents to even get there (I really appreciate them, but it just makes me feel like I’m not ready or independent and like I can’t have my own schedule, it just feels really so stressful to me). I just had a year and a half off and I don’t know why I don’t feel ready or can’t even get myself to do anything, this class and another one have “journal” type assignments where you have to do about 5 3-page papers about the readings but you have to turn the first one in next week. I just have no clue where to start and feel so overwhelmed by just those assignments I guess, I feel like there is really no guidance or starting point about them. I’m trying to do all of this with no motivation and being extremely depressed and it just isn’t working, and I really thought that after taking over a year off, trying meds/therapy, and just trying to feel prepared would change things but it just didn’t. I want already (2 weeks in) to drop down to part time, a more manageable just 3 online classes (even though the prof in my in-person class seems really great, the readings are really interesting etc). But this time I really can’t do that no matter how much I think it would help, I have to be full time so my parents can get more of a refund on taxes this year( I’ve tried to talk to my mom and she gets really mad and disappointed), I have to finish a full time semester to try to get my almost-full tuition scholarship back (doesn’t sound like much, but I think it would really pretty much pay for me to be in an on-campus apartment and I think that would really help me, so I feel like I really need to stay in this now so next year could maybe go better). 

TLDR: just really already feeling extremely depressed and overwhelmed. I can’t get myself to start on any important/big assignments, it all feels overwhelming and too much for me to handle (I guess I must be stupid). Going to just 1 in person class after a year of not doing much at all feels so stressful and overwhelming. Again I just can’t get myself to do anything or even feel like it matters.

82,se8tgw,2022-01-27 21:12:13,CollegeRant,Campus Doesn’t Feel Safe,"Hey all, I just needed to vent and maybe ask for a bit of advice and see if there’s anything I can do. 

My school refuses to handle skyrocketing omicron and Covid cases properly. They informed us to wear a mask on campus if we felt unsafe but that they would not be returning to remote learning (in fact they got rid of most of the remote learning courses in favor of in person classes). 

As someone who not only has a weakened immune system after dealing with a non-Covid bacteria infection that put me out for weeks but I also care for my elderly grandparents. This is extremely concerning. I’ve done everything right, I’m vaccinated and boosted. I wear a mask, I take the proper precautions but people are also not doing their proper duties. They’re coming to class sick and are coughing all over the place and don’t wear their masks. I live in a pretty big republican space so there’s not much I can do besides ensure I keep my distance and deal with it. 

Is there anything that I’m not thinking of? Is there a way that I can explain to my Professors that I don’t feel safe returning to campus and ask to watch the class recordings and have that count as attendance? Is there a way that I can get an accommodation for this semester? I’m a second semester senior so I’m so close to finishing and it’s really disheartening that they made it impossible to feel safe this semester by removing all the online options we had.",1,1,anathaem
83,sdrgl7,2022-01-27 06:02:47,CollegeRant,I absolutely hate my college experience.,"\*This is a really long read\*

I am not sure why I am writing this but I have found in the past whenever I am able to write my thoughts down and share them to the human world I get a sense of relief that I cannot explain.

I recently turned 20 and attending my cities local community college. Since the pandemic hit at the same year I was graduating high school, my family for financial reasons had to move to a pretty garbage city in my state. I'll spare everyone my life story but was bummed to not be able to go to my accepted local CSU where virtually every single one of my friends has gone to. I had been a pretty bad student and son throughout my highschool years, and the pandemic hitting and getting a reality check from the seriousness of my families financial situation triggered something inside of me that made me do a complete 180 in my personal journey. I abandoned all types of distractions, through time slowly begun losing touch with my own friends since I feel they lost all types of real connection with me, and just really focused on bettering and studying on my own because I realized the only person who will help me or my family is my family and I.

Once Fall semester came around at my community college, I took 4 classes and aced all of them. I think it had been the first time since middleschool where I actually had amazing grades and felt a sense of proudness from my parents which I had been deprived of for years. I however got too confident, I let my guard down, I fell down a spiral to my old addiction (green), and ultimately failed 2 of my computer science classes, out of 5 total I was taking. I got great grades on the others. It sucks because for virtually everyday since the pandemic I had been studying programming on my own, and even built a lot of fairly large scale projects and even did some marketing/websites for some local dentists. I would say I am fairly well versed and on the right track, and I can come up with a huge heap of excuses on why I failed those two classes (family problems, addiction, mental health), but I am also faced with the harsh reality of the adult world that ultimately all of this was my choice. I chose not to give it my all. I chose not to focus. The nature of online learning may have a small role in making the learning experience mundane but if anything, it should be 100x easier since most teachers at this school either don't really care or are all over the place. I promised myself I would come back from this, and retook those classes in the summer and passed them both. Although I was aware the taint on my transcript will forever stay there, and eventually the guilt and self flagellation took over. I could not look my parents in the eyes for weeks and months, which ultimately made me cope with the same thing that destroyed my life in the first place.

I can accept that I am a very weak minded individual and have never learned to cope properly. It could be because of the on-going family issues growing up and all my life, or it could just be that I look to blame others for my own faults like I have my entire life. I had taken a math class, the only one, in person, and it was a 30-40 minute drive for a 1 hour lecture. At this point I was \*\*oking copious amounts, and mentally I was at my darkest. It definitely does sound extremely corny writing this and looking back. Ultimately, and this is what hurts the most, I failed 3 out of the 5 classes I was taking. My GPA dropped to a 2.6, and am currently sitting there until I can retake my Calculus class (a third time thanks to a counselor approval, and also the only class worth 4 credits I failed so it's a heavy toll on my GPA for now) this Spring semester of 2022.

After god knows how many attempts, I have been sober all of 2022 since Christmas, and genuinely have true disgust towards substances and I never want to fall back ever. It's done for me, I tapped out, I accepted I simply am not responsible for it. Regardless, the Spring semester has finally came around and started last week. I would assume that since I made another somewhat big change in my life that I would be content and move forward and give it my all. But everyday it just seems to get worse. The shame and guilt at times becomes extraordinarily hard to deal with. I had started my college life in 2020 with the intention that I had finally matured and grown up from the disaster I once was. Bragging about my perfect GPA, how I was going to easily transfer to my local CSU here in the new city and finally make something of myself. But looking at my transcript, looking at my GPA, I realize I maybe have sealed all of that away. My parents know none of this and live under the delusion that I have been doing great just like I have when I started. I cannot comprehend how I was able to fall back into the same dark holes I once was so proud of escaping.

I understand this probably comes off as another cringe over-dramatic college student rant about how much everything sucks despite having a lot of privileges others in the world dream of having, but I genuinely have rough times seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. At my current rate I would be able to transfer after another year, when my initial plan was just 2. Due to my financial situation I've got an absurd amount of financial aid which I don't spend on anything despite helping family here and there, and the stress of knowing that if I fuck up I have to pay all of that back also does not help. I am not sure what to do anymore. I currently just find joy in helping my sister through her first semester of highschool because I don't want her to follow my same footsteps or be a fuck-up like I was most of my life. Things are going great for her and I find a lot of happiness in that. These past 2 weeks I have done nothing but study on my subjects and do homework practically all day, but my fried brain and shit memory are letting me down again, and I feel like nothing I am doing is working. I look at my 'friends' and they seem to all be doing just fine in their classes (they share a lot of the same ones), and seem like they're somewhat enjoying their experience. I see them stay up till 3 in the morning playing games and buying new ones and I cannot grasp how they have the time to do any of it. I cannot remember the last time I picked up a videogame or spent any leisure in doing anything. Even when I was \*\*oking it would mostly just be me in my room thinking about everything wrong I have ever done in my life and listening to music. Those moments were dark but were also helpful in the sense that they ultimately pushed me to become better and just try to move forward.

I have a quiz tomorrow in math and despite studying as much as I can and doing all the homework, I feel extremely unprepared. The professor is young and extremely funny and cool, but my god the lectures are a torture. Reading ratemyprofessor doesn't help either. I ultimately just feel lost. I feel hopeless. If I fail this class attempt I would have run out of my 3 attempts and I cannot retake this mandatory class for my major. I cannot even imagine what I would do if that were the case. Lately I have been having a strange infatuation with the concept of mortality, it is all very strange. I have seen the dark side of mental illness my entire life, and never imagined to be on that side of it. I sometimes do contemplate the worse as I feel it would be the only way to shake off the extreme feelings of discontent in my life. Even if things do go amazing for me and I one day fast forward and see myself transferring to the university, this city just sucks in general and I feel like it will always be a dead end for me. It sucks because I never could have for a second imagined as a kid this would be my college experience or my life now. I understand I am young and have everything ahead of me, but how does one feel hopeful for a future that everyday let's you down. I sometimes do think that the burden (both financial, personal, mental) I would relieve to my family in a very dark sense if I were gone would outweigh a lot of things, but I understand this is an extremely sick and skewed perception. I don't think I would ever do anything out of this world, but it's just a really weird feeling having this dark cloud consume you everyday. I find joy in the little things in life now, like going grocery shopping with my mom or catching up on a movie at night with my family. Maybe it's because deep down I have this feeling that everyday could be my last or that everything in this life is fragile.

I wish I could be a better person. I wish I could just own up to my mistakes. But the concept of self-forgiveness is extremely difficult when I understand that ultimately what I have to do as a student and as a son is super easy... just do the work and move on. It sucks because deep down I know that in this life only those who put in the work and got it will ultimately succeed. I have seen my father, who is ridiculously talented and intelligent and immigrated here at my age, despite working his ass off every single day be casted aside like nothing. I thought I was going to one day be the ""hero"" of my family but nowadays I just feel like both a burden and a leech. It's hard to imagine any one of my 'friends' feel the same way, so maybe this is just my attempt to try and reach out and see if anyone has ever felt the same or feels the same, or has seen the other side of this incredibly dark and twisted reality I have built around myself. I try to smile throughout the day and realize there is always a glimmer of hope in everything, and maybe that's what keeps me going, but often times I have my moments of grief and self-hatred that quite literally paralyze me both mentally and physically.

I appreciate anyone who's time I may have wasted with this incredibly long post, and even more so if anyone finds the time to reply with literally anything. A song that gets you through the hard times, a similar story, experience, shared compassion. Quite literally anything.",1,1,neural-nyetworks

Professors now a days seem to take the easy way out. For instance ""Look at the end of the chapter of your textbook for the topic"". Instead of writing all that out, wouldn't it have been faster just to post the topic along with the damn assignment?!?! Why make student's waste money for damn questions in a textbook?!?!?

85,s9m6qf,2022-01-21 22:00:47,CollegeRant,Severe social anxiety is ruining my experience.,"Long story short here. I’m a sophomore this year, but I spent my entire freshmen year at a different school online due to covid, so I am essentially experiencing this year like a first year college student. 

I’ve packed my stuff and I plan to move back in tomorrow but I really, really am dreading it. I’ve been coming to terms with the fact that I have social anxiety and this past fall semester has really opened my eyes to how much it effects my life. 

I had a really hard time and never really made friends. It didn’t help that I transferred, I entered a new school with 0 connections where everyone already established friends. I joined groups and did all the things they said to do to make friends, I’d say I’ve met people, but never really made friends. I kept trying, but it really got hard and it made my mental health dwindle. 

By the beginning of October, my day to day experience began to become extremely lonely. I woke up, studied in a cafe, went to class, went to a study room in the library between class, went to my dorm, finished my work and went to bed by 9pm. Physically I became really healthy, but mentally I was a train wreck. I socially felt like I shut off, just gave up. 

With my month break, I’ve become aware of the duality of who I am at home and who I become on campus, and I am petrified  to go back to that kind of life. I have been so happy at home just socializing with my siblings, having people to talk to and express myself around. I don’t really know the point of this rant, other than really to ask for suggestions on what I can do from day one to make this semester any better than how it went last fall.",1,1,Beneficial_Regular_8
86,s9iwri,2022-01-21 19:36:27,CollegeRant,Unbearable group member and I have to met him in every class now,"I got into a group last year, 5 person per group, 3 persons have pre-existing relationship. The groups doesn't want to discuss that often even on MT live. So I thought this group prefer ""Laissez-faire"" style of doing project, but then each week whenever we need to report progress to lecturer, they didn't do anything, whole week won't even talk at whatapps group at all until day before reporting the progress. They only discuss when some of the report progress week has to give mark individually.  


Our project is actually about creating a comic which is pretty much nonsense course. So we assign the work according to like comic artist way, colouring, scripting and line art. So this dude who is the doing scripting and drafting, whenever I ask for his draft, he need to use 1 day sometime 3 days to reply me with an answer: ""No I haven't done yet, many **individual** assignments I haven't done yet"" But when I offer him to help draft, he said no need, he will do it himself. After he done the draft, he stop working on the project and let everything ""Laissez-faire"".

  
And I have become leader else this group is very dooming as ""Laissez-faire"" seem not working at all. Ok, I admit I miscalculated that this ""dude"" who do the script and draft is such an ass,  and I am wrong too. I shouldn't give him to do the drafting but hey then again, I **did** offer to help him do the draft but he insist that this is his story so he want do it himself. FAIR, but after that he won't do the later part of the assignment.   


He also kinda get the wrong idea when I said I will help him do the draft he asked me to help him do his individual assignment instead. After he keep ignoring and saying he dont have time for later part of the assignment, I snapped and tell him (in whatapps cause we was having online class) cant he do something and he didn't do shit. He then refute me said he done a lot of scripting and draft and then he proceed to say those nonsense words passive-aggressively.  


Ok, after that, few days left before we submit our assignment. The dude promise us said he will help us to draw last three pages and speech. Guess what, he didn't do until LAST fricking day before submission! I tried to text him day before, he online but he ignore me, I even offer to do all his shit he unwilling to do. He only reply me at morning last day of submission at morning and he just rush to draw that last three pages with ugly ass drawing (He actually very skilled in drawing/painting, his individual assignment art very pretty but group it looks toddler drawing)   
Our project also need some kind ""game"" on the comic like puzzle or shit like that, I said before that they wont report the progress whenever we need to check with lecturer. So the game idea all come from me because no one want to give and our lecturer approved it that time. This fucker dude, always said he want to change the game idea, but then whenever I want to find him to discuss he just said busy, not replying until last 3 hours before submission. He freaking told me to change his game idea and when I ask further questions he passive aggressively told me he want to have dinner so don't bother him, I fucking cry that time I was literally doing the last few thing of that assignment while eating in front of my laptop. I gave up, I just find A and told her to help me check without this dude knowledge and pass it out.   


We have group member evaluation too, but I didn't plan to bad mouth that dude. The dude explicit said in the group chat ""Hey should we hold hand or jump off from the bridge together?"" He is kinda hinting that he want shit on me on the evaluation. Of course I shit on him, but lecturer didn't minus any of our marks anyway, probably because both side kinda wrong. Fast forward, I have go to college again in person after 1 year of online class. But I have to meet this asshole in many classes to come. What do I do? I afraid of facing this person, he kinda traumatized me.

87,s89q70,2022-01-20 04:09:06,CollegeRant,Feeling overwhelmed,"just need a place to vent. I have a class this semester where the professor does not seem very organized. I have had to email him several times already due to certain aspects of the canvas page not being filled out properly, not working, or missing rubrics.  I attend entirely online because I work full time and it allows some flexibility. However this class I'm taking has a zoom meeting every Thursday evening that, while is not required to attend, does have a point value assigned to attendance. Theres also multiple writing projects a week, which I understand. What I dont understand though, and what is overwhelming me the most is that our semester started on Tuesday, and the professor expects us to read 3 chapters of text (around 64 pages of reading) by Thursday and have a full understanding of it to answer multiple questions regarding the content in a discussion board that is due on Thursday as well as be ready to discuss and answer questions regarding it in our Thursday zoom meeting. 

I understand deadlines, I haven't had a single problem with deadlines. However expecting so much text to be read and understood in exactly 3 days feels so overwhelming to me. I worked all day Tuesday, came home and completed class work for another class that was due today (which was much simpler so I understand knocking it out quickly).

I'm having a hard time. My classes are already more overwhelming than I thought they'd be. In person for the first time in a while. It's a ton of biochem. Two of my three not-biochem courses are taught by a biochem instructor, so they have a huge biochem component. I like biochem to an extent but I do biology because I love ecosystem science. I have none of that this semester and it's killing my motivation. 

I found out I was pregnant the first day of this sem. Yes I use protection, it just broke. So I've missed three classes now for appointments surrounding my termination, because they're only offered during my school and work hours. Ended my pregnancy last night (kept me up until 4 am) and genuinely slept through a lab meeting this morning out of exhaustion and negligence. I woke up to emails and obviously there's no good way to explain my absence.

I'm thinking about dropping a class but I really can't afford to. Dropping now only means my next semesters get more crowded, or I throw away my plan to graduate in a year by failing to finish a course or two. I feel like such a mess.

To make things worse everyone is getting covid and they're still taking their time to shift to an online format. So I know everything is going upside down in a week or two and I'm just waiting for it to happen. Most of my classes already have numerous positive cases.

Well, I have no choice because my university never has an online option. I have already studied online for 1 year plus and I absolutely love it. It is more manageable and I am able to focus better than real life class to be fair because well no students bother me when it is online and I can just toss the phone away if somebody bothers me, unlike in real life where I have to answer them in class. Yeah I know social interaction or going outside is important but I can do it with just online classes, I mean I can go out and have fun with friends instead of going out for university and staying at that depressed building for 5~8 hours straight. Also, I have to prepare to meet shitty classmate that I met during online class, I can block them online but now I have to face them. There will also be some shitty lecturer too expect we students to have no life other than study and do great in their class. All of these factors, dystopian university building,
shitty real life classmates and lecturers made me dreading to go to university starting from next week.

Currently, we have hybrid classes but only two days are online, I seriously don't want to go back to normal, normal university wasn't even good anyway, it just the same shit that I have to work on assignments or study for 10+ hours straight and have as low as 1 hour to 4 hours sleep even it is on online. Imagine now I have to cut down some time for travel and wake up earlier for going back to school. Thinking about all of them just make me feel depressed...

Just here to rant a bit since some of my peers are excited to go back for ""socialization"", bet some of them will regret it too. Sorry...

So going into J Term this year (17 day term with 1 class everyday) covid is terrible and going to spike cause of the holidays. As of right now my college has said how we can request accommodations for classes if we get quarantined (basically at the mercy of our teachers) but the college is not advertising anything on their end for online learning. J term is a class that if you miss 3 days without communication from a teacher it is recommended that you drop the class, but if you go into quarentine for 10 to 7 days and your teacher doesn't make accommodations? Blows my mind. Students who even got tested or were e posed were told to unenroll and that the credits will be added to spring term free of charge.

should i ask if shes seen it? Or if i ask, do i look like i wanted a heart react from her???

I am in in my junior year of college and I’m not really excited to return back to school. I had my freshman year cut short because of covid, and I spent my sophomore year completely online living at home. Safe to say, I got comfortable being at home and I’m really close with my family so this past semester living on campus again was kinda difficult for me.

It’s kinda sad to say but I go most days without talking to anyone in person. I go to class, the gym, then come home and study most days. Of course there are the interactions I have with my roommates but we are not close so it’s mostly just small talk. The only thing I look forward to are when I call my sisters or parents because like I said we are really close.

The thing is, I have friends and people I hang out with but I’m not like anyone’s closest friend if that makes sense. Like I don’t think any of my college friends would refer to me as one of their closest friends. 

Does anyone have any tips on how to form a friend group? The one thing I’m counting on this semester is I’m getting more into the specific classes for my major so the classes will be smaller and essentially everyone will be all in the same classes so I’m hoping I can find a study group and see where it goes from there.

I attend a small college and I’m perusing a degree in Ecology. My chemistry courses so far have been the bane of my existence and are making me question if I’m even smart enough to bother going to college. After transferring from a community college I was placed in Chem II. The lecture and lab taught by two different prof who did not communicate at all which I feel is a big red flag from my understanding. I had a wonderful professor for the lecture portion passed it with a 90%. The lab portion however not so much. There’s only one professor teaching the chem labs and she is brutal. She leaves no room for questions and expects you to know everything about what you’re doing that day the moment you walk in the door. My classmates have told me she gets visibly annoyed when anyone asks her a question in class and I’ve seen her needless agitation first hand. She also has no office hours. Her TAs are no help either. I was unable to go to any of their online only office hours because they all overlapped with other classes I had. The TA’s grade but only mark up/give feedback to SOME people leaving other peoples work blank. I was one of those people. I didn’t find out that they gave feedback at all until the semester was over after talking to some classmates after I had already dropped the class. I had failed each and every assignment with no help/feedback on either end. this semester I plan on taking Chem I to see if that helps maybe. At this rate it will be another three semesters before I get to Organic Chem. I feel like I’ve already lost before I’ve even begun.,1,1,Harpo1999

105,rl8aj7,2021-12-21 06:30:59,CollegeRant,Recent Terrible Group Assignment Experience,"**Do you prefer group or individual assignments?**

Hey everyone here, I am curious about your experiences in group assignments. Do you prefer individual assignments or group ones? To be honest, I enjoy individual group assignments much more because people can be total assholes when it comes to group work; like seriously, it's common sense to contribute in a group assignment, no?

Being in online classes doesn't mean you can just be mute and ghost your teammates like there's no tomorrow. Here's a story of my recent group assignment experience, featuring an under-performing teammate who loves to ghost and lie. Thinking of sharing this experience as it may benefit others within this community, especially when dealing with parasites like these.

**Here's my story**

This semester, we had a 3-person group assignment which involved writing a project proposal, coding and data analysis, performing a survey, as well as writing a short report afterwards to summarise the work that has been done in this project. This project spanned across around **7 weeks** so it's quite a large-scaled work. Let's call my other two other teammates **L** (he/him) and J (she/her). At later points of this story, I will refer to he/him as teammate **L**, and she/her as teammate **J**.

In the beginning of the project, the three of us wrote a project proposal in which all three of us contributed quite evenly. The professor accepted our proposal, and at this point in time I thought to myself that this project will definitely go smoothly, and felt a sense of relief. But oh boy was I wrong in the **EXECUTION PHASE** of the project.

When it came to workload distribution, all three of us agreed that each of us would work on a specific part of the project, merge our parts into a common codebase and write the report later on to consolidate on our works. Heck, if we don't have the code or app ready, there's nothing that we can write in the report, right? So we get started to work on our individual parts (at least that's what I thought).

So I started a Github repository and invited **L** and **J** to join this repository. **L** joined the repository quickly and periodically pushed the work that he has done to our codebase, whereas.... **J** is nowhere to be found. I tried messaging **J** but she ghosted me for 3 weeks, and never joined our Github repo even till the end of the project. **L** was an amazingly good team player, and both of us continued to have coding sessions through video calls to work on the application for this project. **L**'s coding skills are top-notch, and he wrote most of the code for our project; the most complicated parts of this project was done by him and I could not even understand how he managed to implement the toughest and most impressive features in our application. Midway through the project alongside **J** ghosting us, I presented our application to the professor and the professor was amazed and blown away by it. That's how the results that **L** and I were able to achieve thus far (thank you **L**) at the absence of **J**. At this stage, our app was almost done and **L** and I still haven't gotten a response from **J**, and the only part left was **J**'s part.

At this point in time, **L** and I decided that the two of us would just takeover **J**'s allocated work and we assumed that she wasn't interested in contributing to the project, even for her part. Before we took over her part, I tried calling **J** 5 times and finally got through. She told me that ""she does not know anything about how to do for her part, or for any other parts in the project"" (even though the professor has covered it in lectures), and that her Final Year Project (FYP) supervisor was ""being extremely unreasonable, set unrealistic expectations and deadlines"". She said that her FYP actually has 2 supervisors, and she has not met her ""hidden"" supervisor yet, which suddenly gave **additional requirements that demanded her merging her FYP with several other students in the same faculty, and that it wasn't ""what I signed up for in a FYP""** (In this paragraph I'm citing her exact words in quotes). She then proceeded to give more excuses that seemed like it was just made up on the spot on our phone call. In a casual voice call with her best friend, the best friend revealed that she has actually completed her FYP, and does not want to contribute in other group assignments for all subjects in this semester.

By now, the excuses that she provided gave me the worst impression that she is extremely terrible in time management, or has zero interest towards the project, or only joined our team with the intention to free ride. But hey, free riding and leeching off others is a lifestyle, and perhaps she's just **REALLY GOOD** at taking things for granted.

After **L** and I were done with the project codes and result evaluations, we were about to get started on compiling the report (it was 3 days before the hard deadline). Here, we already have the main parts of the contents, and just needed to compile it. When the two of us were on the verge of removing **J**'s name from our group, **J** suddenly replied me and mentioned that she would like to work on the project report. At this point, **L** and I were done with writing the technical aspects of the report, with only the remaining bits and pieces of fluff to be written. **L** told me that her sister was tested COVID positive, and thus I have decided to split the writing work of the remaining parts of the report, seeing that **L** did most of the work so far and it's my time to give back. The work left wasn't much, as it was just around 2 hours worth of writing for each of us.

Later came the peer evaluation form for us to evaluate each other, and she gave extremely low marks towards **L** and lied that he did not contribute at all in the project, mentioning that the project might as well be just the work of J and I. Hey, excuse me?? You're the one under-performing and you're blaming another teammate?? I'm not even your friend and you're pretending that we're best friends? Can you believe it, someone who's willing to lie and steal for no reason. Extremely petty and unreasonable.

Sometimes I just can't understand what's wrong with people, especially those who are too used to lying and cheating. But to be very honest, I should have just removed her name from our group from the very beginning.

I finally get it now, some people are born to lie, cheat, and steal; it's their nature to do so.

At the end of this story, if you're asking me what I've learnt in terms of managing people: identify less contributing members early on and just chop them out of the team. If you're a free-rider who's not willing to even complete your own part, get lost and find a ""better"" team that suits you better. Don't be a parasite that takes things for granted and causes harm because **NO ONE LIKES IT.**

**TL;DR:** In a 3-person group project, a teammate ghosted another teammate and I throughout the whole project, and lied to the lecturer that the other teammate didn't contribute at all. Being in an online class, even though your teammates may not get the chance to know you physically doesn't mean you can just under-perform, ghost your teammates, and lie like there is no tomorrow.

&amp;#x200B;

I spent so much of my time into that class. Studying, going to 2 different tutors, reading the slide shows, which side rant, was fucking bull shit. My professor told us it's best to listen/watch to his video lecture while reading the slides but the videos had poor audio, he barely followed the slides, he did problems on what I think was on Microsoft paint and you could barely read what he wrong. I brought this up with him and he told me, ""Just reading the slides is good enough. I'm paying this guy to send my power points for me to figure out on my own.

For homework, we had to use some program called ALEKs, which will walk you through step by step on how to do the problem then tell you you did it wrong. It basically breaks up the unit into different topics and you have to get a certain amount of questions right before you can move on. What really pissed me off though is that those ALEKs topics were the only way to receive extra credit in that class. If you want FIVE extra points on your next exam, you need to spend at least 30 mins on ALEKs EVERY DAY, get at least one topic done EVERY DAY, and finish all the topics by the due date. And what happens if you miss even one of those days? FUCK YOU, YOU DON'T GET THAT F I V E EXTRA POINTS.

I spent so much god damn time in that class studying and practicing only to get shitty grades on tests and finals was even worse. It was an online proctored exam at 7 in the fucking morning, so not only was I anxious and stressed for this test that would determine my final grade but I was also exhausted because I had just spent the last few nights staying up to study for this bullshit exam.

At the end of the day, I finished that class with a C and I guess I should be happy with it.

109,rfk4l0,2021-12-13 16:50:58,CollegeRant,I’m so pissed about my final,"Long story and I’m starting from the beginning.

A couple days ago I had a meeting with my counselor that was an hour or so long. I left feeling very positive. I got into my car and I checked canvas as habit. My eyes bulged out of my head because on my to die list is says “ FINAL EXAM LOCKDOWN BROWSER due at 1:15 pm” . I check the time it was 12:15 pm. Im full on panicked mode because the exam wasn’t until the 13 in class not right now online. Im in my car quickly reaching for my laptop. I think to myself that I can’t make it home to do the test so I had to do it my car. Side note: I really could’ve went back in my school building. All I had to do was pray that laptop was charged. Thankfully it was. I decided to take the exam in my car. 

So im taking the exam that im not fully prepared for at all but I’m thinking it’s better than a 0. As I literally only had 6 questions left my exam locks me out. The questions disappeared. I was in disbelief until I checked my phone notifications. My prof changed the due date to the 13.  I tried to exit locked down browser but couldn’t because it said I was still on an activity. So I was stuck. I emailed my professor IMMEDIATELY of the situation.  All he said was he never changed the date and it was always Monday. I’m like ok fine I’ll just take the exam again in person. No biggie. 

The night before my final I couldn’t sleep. I spent all night studying. Yes I know it’s bad thing to do but I did it anyway. I showed up to class mildly prepared and ….no one showed up. My professor was in his office so I think maybe I’m to early. A classmate showed up and we started talking. After awhile we started to get confused so went to go see the professor. We ask if the final is today and he says “yes online”. We politely exit and once out of sight We let loose. 

On canvas he tells us the final is in person and all we have to bring to class is pencils. ALso he says nothing about this in my email from before. I quickly remembered that I technically already took the exam but couldn’t finish it so I went to go speak with him. I explained the situation and he says at first theirs nothing he can do it says I took the exam for an hour. I quickly EXPLAINED again with more clarity on why that was the case. He finally says that I can finish rest of my questions. 

I’m happy for that but I’m pissed as fuck that this situation happened to me to begin with. I took an examp way early than I meant too that I could’ve aced just to get a B.  I pass the class which is great but I wanted a certain grade to help with my gpa but now that’s in the toilet. They’re things I did wrong in the class and I kinda wish one of them was not taking the exam the first time.",1,1,okbrunch
110,re6mhv,2021-12-11 19:15:31,CollegeRant,"Need advice, stressed and considering dropping out to self-educate","I attend a community college and have about 5 classes left before I graduate with an associates in businsess. I'm heavily considered dropping out because of overwhelming stress relating to school. I believe that I could teach myself more efficiently and effectively on my own, but I feel like I need a degree and want to experience graduate school some day.

Early in school I was considered ""gifted"" and skipped a grade but I failed almost every class in highschool and dropped out due to depression. In college I currently have a 3.9 GPA. Part of my stress comes from perfectionism and trying to maintain my GPA. This stresses me out because I feel like I need to maintain a high GPA if I want to transfer to a ""good"" college in the future. I feel like I missed my chance in high school. I never took the SAT. 

I already dropped out of college once due to stress. Now I have only been taking two classes a semester but still struggle with stress from school and the idea of graduating ""late"". For context I am nearly 25 and feel so far behind my peers. I've tried to break down the reasons for my stress as follows:

Most of my classes have been taken digitally and my experience with them has been that the teachers are practically absent and it's as if the class is fully automated. We mainly read out of a textbook and then do exercises made by some learning company like Mcgraw Hill or Norton. We have weekly discussions where most students bullshit and write responses like ""I agree!"" as part of a participation grade. Students do not really reach out to each other, there are no study groups or anything like that. Powerpoints slides are pre-prepared by these companies and nearly every exam question is copy pasted from Google. I wish I was in an environment where the teachers and students were more active.

When I don't understand something, there isn't anyone I can ask for help. Google isn't always reliable and for someone who doesn't understand the material figuring it out on your own can be a very long and frustrating process. Something that takes me an hour of googling could be answered in a few minutes by a teacher, and often what I find online doesn't match the format of my assignment. Most teachers write back by email in a few days, the response time is far too slow to learn effectively. 

I also don't like the way some information is presented and sometimes get stuck when I can't understand it. Because most lessons build on knowledge previously learned, this is a recipe for repeated frustration when I come across something requiring knowledge that I did not fully understand the first time.

I'm also very disappointed in the level of organization of my teachers. It is very common for assignments to have incorect dates posted, typos, and missing submission links.

I'm stuck and overwhelmed. I'm trying to hold out thinking that I might get a better education/learning experience at a better college but I don't know if that will be the case. 

What should I do?",4,1,HeyLookNiceThrowaway

I had some shit happen back in January and basically lost all (2) my friends, and moved out of my apartment with them to be home. I had many breakdowns and tons of medication changes with my psychiatrist. I went to multiple therapists. Last semester I only took 3 courses and got Cs (which hey, Cs get degrees lol), but this semester I originally had 6 and dropped 4. One class was only from late Aug to mid Oct so the past couple months I’ve only had one class. All my classes were online last semester and this one.

My final is due at midnight. I didn’t start it, and I’m not going to. I have a 12% in that class. My mental health has been all over the place and even if I ace it, my grade would only go up to 17%. 

Im just exhausted and losing all my motivation. My parents berated me when I had a B- average, but I can’t tell them I got a fucking 12% in my ONLY CLASS. 

Im just starting to not care about anything and education is definitely not my top priority, but at the same time I’m just so disappointed in myself.

112,rdfh87,2021-12-10 18:45:30,CollegeRant,We Love A Ridiculous and Homophobic Professor :),"I am an idiot. I did not look up my professors prior to this semester. What a big mistake on my end. Now, to preface, I have had 13 professors and classes prior to this. A majority of them came from this college. I have only ever had issues with one professor, which was not MY professor but a club leader, being homophobic and transphobic. 

Well, isn't it my luck? I have another one. 

So, this is an accelerated 7 week course. I work two jobs due to my demographic and lack of support at home. So, this is an ONLINE course.

To start, the professor has told EVERYONE on the first week, ""You will NEVER be eligible for 100% on anything. You have chosen the path of an online course which is substantially easier than a live lecture. Your grade will reflect as much.""

Which I said whatever. I am very good at course work, anyway, and I didn't think this would matter. 

The first few grades she gave me? Well below passing because I was giving ""too much detail"" and ""in a debate, I wouldn't have this time."" Which?? This is a history course. This is NOT debate class or public speaking course. I am not even a history major. So, I have less detail and just summarized my initial posts. ""You are giving too little detail!/ This is irrelevant without more to add!"" I started to stress out because I was writing too much or too little. I EMAILED her several times, too, to get feedback and she would never response. Then, one day I get an email about my profile picture which contained the hint of a pride button. ""You should not be wearing any form of media that is not neutral to your school."" 

From there, she started to spell my name wrong. :) Every single time. I would correct her politely. I sign my emails, it is in my documents, it is PUBLIC and I'd email her.

""Hey, my name is spelled \*\*\*\* not \*\*\*\*.""

Never. Got. A. Response.

Well, due to depression and needing a hospital visit and starting new meds, I was out of school for a week. All of my professors understood the circumstances of this situation and granted me more time to do my work, with my documentation and such to show I was genuinely just struggling. I was waiting on student disabilities to approve everything to. THIS PROFESSOR TOLD ME MY DEPRESSION WAS MY FAULT and that if I worked harder, I would not have missed an assignment but she was giving me ""permission"" to make those assignments up. However, I should ""feel special"" because ""if I break that rule for one student, I have to break it for ALL of them."" She gave me ONE DAY. Well, due to my news medication and the extreme fatigue, I hadn't even realized I had the email because I had a week's worth of other work to focus on and then my ACTUAL jobs needed me back since I work in two office positions. By the time I had her assignments done, it was a few days later. I emailed her again, and she DID NOT respond.

&amp;#x200B;

I can sympathize. People are busy. School is busy. It's been two weeks, I tried her again. She told me ""You know from your records that you used your one-time free pass. I don't make exceptions because it's not fair for other students, in the past and in the present."" I told her I NEVER had a chance to use it and I was reaching out to submit the work.

This lead to a full fledged internet squabble where I finally snapped on her and TOLD her if she was confused on my previous emails, she needed to reach out and make that clear. I reached out to my academic dean...

Nothing will probably come of this....

I just wasted my breath.

I get a pell grant so I’m afraid if I bomb the class it’ll get taken away. Years ago when I first started college I failed my first couple classes and they took it away, I convinced them to give it back to me and I’ve maintained decent grades As and Bs and a decent GPA 3.3. Im only 3 classes away from my associates on top of this. How screwed will I be if I let myself fail this class. I’m so burnt out. I’m at the point where I almost don’t even care.

117,rbp5x0,2021-12-08 11:19:42,CollegeRant,"Something has to give. I'm running around like a headless chicken, constantly on the verge of falling apart but I never do?","I do wish I was the person who could do a lot more but I'm so easily distracted. Honestly I used to be even worse with this but I wonder where my time goes. I guess I could delete Instagram, Reddit, Facebook, and Twitter and find out how much free time I really have but I convince myself I need it. Even though I've socially withdrawn a lot, several of my close friends are busy in committed relationships, others have other friend groups, and it feels so hard to meet people in the middle of the semester.

I just don't have the energy. To function, to do anything. I have to prop myself up on caffeine to function on six hours of sleep while that is a high amount for a weekday for some of my friends. It's like everything I do, even if I like it, takes so much energy and I just want to lay down in bed. But when I do that I feel even more shitty about myself and fall into an existential spiral.

I feel like I've been ""quantity &gt;&gt;&gt; quality"" in my approach to activities/extracurriculars/classes this semester. I don't know how to sustainably put 100% of my effort into something I really enjoy so I've stayed attached to the model of just signing up for as many things as I can, but with few leadership positions, to keep myself busy. I had adopted such a cynical perspective about everything that everyone is just faking it and whatever I'm doing I'll just be faking it too. But I've let a lot of people down, maybe not with the explicit goal to but out of a lack of energy to put into things. How do people show up to meetings for all their organizations every week when they could be an email?

I got ghosted by one of my research assistant supervisors so my income has dried up relatively. But he was an incredibly nice guy and it's literally my fault that I just felt overwhelmed by coming up with ways to code for a certain task so I took a very sloppy piecemeal approach. I'm on a literal full ride to a college thousands of kilometers from home so thankfully I have no debt to worry about.

Anyway, I started this semester with a twenty-credit courseload (overload), two part-time research positions (5-10 hours a week), membership on two committees, a club, and a column for the campus newspaper. I have most of that, but I've just been lethargically going through the motions so that these don't translate into anything real and remarkable as much it would if you heard I've been doing all this stuff. 

I've slept through my 9am macro class somewhere between five and eight times, and luckily there's no automatic fail provision but there goes the 5% participation component of my grade (getting low As on exams/assignments otherwise) and any chance of a good rec letter from a pretty renowned professor. Because I already had previous experience in R and very few did  I also got really overconfident in my R class and didn't show up more than half the time (tbf it was optional) or pay attention and then ended up finishing the midterm in twenty-five minutes, thinking I got everything right... and then getting a solid B when many people did better.

So I need a physical internship for this summer because I am going to mentally (and probably physically) rot if I have to go back to my parents' shitty 100% car dependent corner of Trumpland (important: I don't have a car) for three whole months over the summer. And I don't have family connections to rely on and have failed at proper university networking thus far.  I have one more free summer class worst comes to worst to account for one of those months but I'm already dreading it even though it's December? I'm trying to apply to everything online that I can but I don't particularly stand out in any way so it's going to be a major uphill battle - been ghosted by most November deadline things.

And I've been looking for 'escapes' from reality but none have properly materialized to make me happy? And that lack has perhaps made me feel more disillusioned with myself than not pursuing these in the first place. I have gone on international trips, one of them solo, just over short breaks. They've been fun actually but I've just come back and felt even more shitty. I land late at night and come back absolutely overwhelmed with work and with the realization that I still feel suffocated in this bubble of a small campus. At any rate, largely because of these trips, I will probably get some decent Christmas money but I have $700 to my name rn so I won't be going anywhere else anytime soon.

I also felt insecure about my lack of sexual and relationship experience in this past, so September and October were... weird months. Being on a small LAC campus I matched with 2% of the entire female population of my school on dating apps and I thought I was unattractive before because people didn't directly initiate with me and there must be a reason I didn't get this experience. I am a bit of a physical late bloomer but still... shutting myself out from people and blaming them for not talking to me. Meeting people in various capacities I have materialized a few hookups this semester but the first went HORRIBLE and ended with me never talking to the person again who I felt I got along with (for obvious reasons though), and the others went less bad but I still feel insecure about my performance. Obviously sex isn't everything. I've lost the 'virgin' label but to my surprise I still feel about as insecure I ever did and it hasn't translated to being more social in other contexts. If you haven't had sex yet and just want to hook up to get it over with, trust me you probably won't gain anything especially where your reputation follows you around.

Anyway, that was a bit of a long rant. I don't know what direction it's going in but that applies to my life as well. I constantly feel like things are about to collapse around me but I always limp through the finish line but don't solve the underlying problems. Eventually, life is going to have to come to a head though. It's a rut with few answers. I've become more and more irritable over the last few weeks too at slight things like professors' tones in emails, university admin announcements, loud people, the weather, etc. Not sure where my sanity is...",2,2,AccurateAerieT3188

I completed all of these assignments on time. Two students who have completed them weeks later plagiarized by copy-and-pasting a sentence or two from the paragraph that I wrote and either submitting it verbatim or changing a few words here or there. One of them did it at least four times while the other did it once. I only realized because I saw that I had a comment for my response to the prompt from three weeks ago—it was the one who has done this multiple times, who copy-and-pasted one of the sentences and must’ve accidentally posted it as a comment to me (he also submitted this as his response for that prompt).

No, I do not see this as a form of flattery. I’m actually pretty peeved. I put a good amount of effort into these responses, and I don’t like the fact that others who couldn’t do their own work in a timely manner have decided to mooch off of that. It’s pretty clear that these aren’t their words anyway—I write in a pretty distinctive way—, but I took screenshots and you can see how some of them are literally identical to what I posted before. 

There’s nothing I can find for students who had their work plagiarized in my code of conduct, and the library only referred me to the part for students seeking grievances against professors’ accusations of academic dishonesty. Other than going straight to the professor or confronting the students themselves, I’m not sure what to do.

I’m so annoyed. Just do your own fucking work, it’s not that hard. But if you’re going to cheat, at least try to be somewhat clever about it—that means not just lazily copy-and-pasting.",12,32,amermaidfromjupiter

122,ra0cm0,2021-12-06 06:11:24,CollegeRant,Everyone at my college cheats and it’s literally beyond what administration thinks it’s going on.,"It’s funny. Throughout middle school and high school my teachers would talk about the negative effects of cheating to discourage us. Nobody listened, and even the smartest students were cheating in those times.

My first college was a community college I went to for a year. Every class was providing answers one way another. My first semester there I was almost paid to do a classmate’s final essay, but I backed out because I was scared I would be snitched on . Someone else in the class capitalized on the opportunity and got paid $25.

 Students who were not cheating kept quiet. Literally every class in my time there had some form of it, mainly in the WhatsApp group chats. It was so widespread like grade school, but this time it seemed even more people were cheating.

Now I’m in university and it’s the same way. Technology has really enabled this to happen, it’s so easy to work smarter and not harder.

So now to why I’m writing this. The administration at my university has been stressing how academic dishonesty is not tolerable recently, mainly through the professors. And it’s kind of hilarious at this point, because while they’re right in the fact that cheating is widespread, they have no idea that the vast majority of us students are keeping quiet in this process. Another reason why it’ll be tough for them to make a dent on this is because professors have increased tests and assignments online due to covid, which allows for all of the outside resources to be used. Literally every class has at least some assignments based online. 

My main theory is that many professors know what’s going on but wish to have the students act accordingly in discretion. 

My college has no idea that it’s dealing with something that is a part of academic life.",6,1,RhinoJew

I used a term study made for my section that was supposed be for this section for this teacher for this final. It seemed like most of the answers were right. I’m pretty sure what he did was leave certain ones incorrect so no one would catch on.

However, I am in all online classes because I also work full time, and some of these professors do not run online courses well at all. It's so frustrating when a class feels like there's 18 different things going on because the professor isn't clear. She also wants us to reply to 3 different people in every discussion, and it can't be someone we've replied to before, as if I'm keeping a list of everyone's names in my class along with everything else. She has these super specific rules for papers like the font being Arial and having to be a pdf, and the set up of the paper is different from what I was taught in High School/my first year of college. My Anthropology teacher was really hands off, which is fine and he was awesome, but wouldn't tell us what we got wrong on the quizzes/tests (which I'm pretty sure is a setting they just turn on or off) so I never knew what I got wrong, so I couldn't study specifics for the final. &amp; the due dates oh my goodness.. I've had 3 professors now that mix up due dates in the syllabus or even on the online portal and then when it comes to that week/unit, the due dates are different. My English teacher also will put certain directions in the assignments, but then post an example piece that is written differently (like a paragraph instead of 1-2 sentences like she says) and then docks points for it. The due dates though I can't get over it just because it's so hard to plan anything when I have no idea when it's actually due, not to mention the fact that she locks all units until the first day of the week of that unit.

I was a straight A student for my entire life, and I placed a lot of self worth on academic validation. I wanted to take a gap year, but because of c0vid, none of my plans were able to work out. I had to go to school and I didn’t want to, nor did I feel ready. When I moved in, I had a major PTSD episode that pretty much lasted until midterms and I fell super behind. I feel myself falling back into depression and it's so frustrating. I’ve had my mental health pretty under control for the past year and it's really discouraging to regress like this. 

I also never had to study in highschool so I have no strategies, and I have no idea what works for me. I tried doing better for the 2nd part of the semester, but I’m still failing most of my classes. I started off taking 5 classes, but I dropped my bio, and I am going to fail chem. I thought I was passing my stats class because online it says I have an 81, but I calculated my grade and it’s a 58. I know it’s all my fault, I was irresponsible and I didn’t study enough and do all of my assignments. My parents have been very understanding, but I am so scared to tell them that I’m failing stats because I was pretty confident that I could pass. The only classes I’m going to pass are an anthropology elective that’s not related to my major, and a one credit hour class that was pretty much pointless. 

I’m taking the spring semester off. I want to figure out who I am outside of school and work on my mental health. I have an opportunity to do unpaid work in the field that I’m interested in, so I am going to save up and then do that for a few months. I need to learn to separate school from my self worth, because right now I feel like utter shit. I know I was going through a lot mentally for a while, but I still feel awful. I’ve never failed a class in my life, and now I’m failing 2. I feel so discouraged and embarrassed. I wish I had put in more effort, especially at the beginning of the semester. I’ll probably go to a community college next year because I lost my scholarship. I feel like there was a lot of pressure on me to do well because I’m the oldest cousin in my family and I’ve always been kind of an example, and now I’m going to be a college dropout. I feel so ungrateful. I was given the opportunity to get an education, and I had a decent scholarship, and I blew it.

128,r6zf0i,2021-12-02 05:02:41,CollegeRant,"I’ve hated this professor all semester because of lack of information and disorganization, but I finally hit my breaking point today because they were incredibly rude to me- to the point where I am now very anxious about attending class and worried for my grade/GPA. Please give encouragement/advice","This is my professors first semester teaching, and you can tell. There wasn’t a Canvas page until halfway through the semester, and I still don’t have any grades posted. Content of exams and/or assignments was not explained at all. I don’t even know how many points the discussions we did were worth. Both the TA and professor took days to reply to a simple question when I reached out to both of them through email and direct message on Canvas multiple times. 

The syllabus had little to no information on it, the attendance policy was “show up it’s mandatory” Yes, this is about attendance. 

I’ve skipped this class a lot. I don’t know the how much specifically, but based off of their email I’m going to say I’ve skipped around half. I’m not here to make excuses- I know I’ve messed up. But when all the prof does is read the PowerPoint word for word (and then eventually post them online) and attendance is only worth 10% of my grade I figured why not?

I decided to try to get back some of my points today because there were some classes I was late to but I attended. This professor takes attendance by passing out a sheet at the beginning of class, and I arrived after that sheet was passed out. My solution was to take a picture of the board with my phone because it was date and time-stamped so I could show my professor I actually attended class. 

I talked to them after class in-person today about it and it was a weird conversation. I explained that I was late several times but I had proof I was in class, and they cut me off to ask how many classes I’ve missed. “Five or more?” I had no idea what they why they were asking me that but I said it’s been around five (it’s actually been eight.)They then said that I would be fine because of the “five day unexcused absence policy” but I need to get better at getting to class on time. I tried to restart the conversation about I had proof, but they once again cut me off to ask if I signed the attendance sheet. They then said it was my responsibility to sign the sheet no matter when I came in. After that I left because I was so shocked that they weren’t willing to let me talk.

In hindsight this is where I should’ve provided the professor more information, like the fact that I tried more than once to sign the attendance sheet but I couldn’t find it. But I didn’t, so oh well.

So after explaining the situation to two of my closest friends, they both agreed that I should email the professor explaining the pictures as proof (I think I asked if the pictures could count as my signature on the attendance sheet), and to ask what the five day policy was because I couldn’t find it anywhere in the syllabus or on any official university documents.

I got the nastiest, most passive aggressive, disrespectful email of my life hours later. Words were bolded, underlined, italicized, you name it. The first line was just reiterating that I should’ve signed the attendance sheet. After that they berated me for missing so much class, more than eight, which I “claim” to have only been late for. I think they thought I was lying. I don’t think they even looked at the document I provided with the pictures, dates and times.

After that they went on a rant about how it’s their class not the university’s and they’re allowed to make any policy they want. They they told me that I should be incredibly grateful that they allow five unexcused absences before they start taking points off, and for other policies they have implemented that help students. 

I was shaking I was so upset, and I didn’t really know what to say so I just emailed them back thanking them for their time, that I understood and respected their decision, and that I was grateful for their policies.

But I’m so worried about them taking out their anger on my grades. I only have two things left that count for my grade and one of them is currently being graded right now. Also, I’m an honors student and I just got my total gpa up to a 3.5, which is where it has to be for me to graduate with honors. If I don’t do good on my last two assignments this could cause my semester gpa to go to a 3.25. I also want to go to a top 50 law school so if they take their anger out on me it might ruin my future. I can’t even imagine facing my parents. I’m also super afraid they’re going to call me out in front of the class.


TL:DR- I’ve skipped maybe around half of a class because it was boring and because attendance was only worth 10% of my grade. I showed up to 8 classes late and wanted to get credit for them so I talked to the professor after class but they wouldn’t let me explain myself, and they also mentioned a policy that they never explained and wasn’t on their syllabus. I sent them a respectful email actually saying what I wanted to and asking them about the policy. They sent me back an extremely disrespectful email, and they seemed so angry that I’m worried they’re going to take it out on my grades and/or be mean to me in class.

Is it because I studied them in another language? focusing in lecture is hard cuz all of them are in online.

A 3.4 GPA is the median of declaring major gpa needed. I will need 1 A- in my course but I dont see any of them being within grasp not to mention, I need other courses to have B+s for that to matter.

The exams are lecture based and similar to assignments but when I see assignments and past papers I dont see their words appearing in lecture nor tutorial at all. Do they just everyone to know them?

I feel lost , hopeless and alone. I keep studying for the exams but I dont seem to go anywhere.

The one career I’m actually interested in having is art and video media, but the field is incredibly competitive and jobs are way harder to find compared to like STEM fields. Even I struggle in art classes at times because I like to make art at my own pace and not at a deadline.

Okay rant over. If it sounds like I’m being overly pessimistic is because I am. I’ve thought of having so many different careers since middle/high school and none of them stuck to me.

It’s making me feel really pressured  because of it.",2,1,orcanio-star

Hi there!

I've heard the saying, ""the first year is always the hardest"" before, and I didn't believe it until now. Here's a sum of the last four months.

&amp;#x200B;

**High School (for Context):**

In high school, I was a terrible, terrible procrastinator who never really needed to study for anything, or would do it last minute if I needed to. I finished fourth in my class with a 4.21 GPA. I was really good at what I called ""doing the bare minimum for an A."" I was heavily involved in a lot of extracurriculars and **extremely** stressed out to the point where I would make myself sick. I even had a teacher tell me to give her the homework by next class and to just rest that night once because I looked so ill. I really cared about going to UMich or getting a full-ride/tuition somewhere, so I really cared about doing well. I did end up both getting into UMich and getting a full-tuition scholarship somewhere, and took the full-ride to a smaller college close to home.

My senior year I was fully online. I had no physical contact with anybody my age until I graduated and my teachers were just pre-recorded videos and people on the other end of an email. My life beforehand was so busy that I never really thought about anything else than what I needed to do, and everything was always taken care of for me in terms of meals and shelter. Then, all I was doing was school, but it was honestly more like all I wasn't doing. My school's counselor called it ""workload paralysis."" Both semesters I ended up with 300+ missing assignments then having to hyperfocus for the last two months to finish them all. Needless to say, I didn't earn any of my AP credits. Fair enough, though. I had scholarships to do and I ended up creating and running a coding club which took up a lot of time, too. I gained so much weight and was tired all the time.

I was really excited because I loved the college I chose, everything just worked out so well. I was determined that this year would be different, but it presented more challenges than I had expected. Thankfully, I have a new counselor who has helped a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

I started off college thinking I was going to be as involved in organizations as I was in high school, excited to meet new people. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Roommate/Housing Situation**

My roommates and I became friends over the summer, but I quickly realized that living with someone is a very different relationship than just being friends with them. They always wanted me to do everything with them, and didn't like when I couldn't. I have a sometimes stressful IT job on-campus and as someone who values rest and is easily overwhelmed/overstimulated, I wanted to come home and shut my door for a bit in a dark room to recharge. They thought that was rude, even though I'd always peek out to say hi every once in awhile when I wasn't doing homework and let them know it wasn't because I didn't want to talk to them but just that I was busy. I also liked to sing and I let them know to just knock if I annoyed them  or was too loud and I'd shut up, which is my system at home too, though I usually only did it when they weren't home or when I thought there wasn't anyone home (and they never used the system).

At the end of August they started ganging up on me for stupid things though like the ""you never spend any time with us and you're never home"" thing, for my laundry basket being too loud?, and for slamming doors (which maybe happened once unintentionally). They made a quiet sign for when they wanted me to shut up. The first WEEK they set quiet hours that they left me out of determining when I was the only one who even had to get myself together earlier than 8am. During the middle of September, the one I was closest to told me the other two who were best friends before college were talking about me behind my back to her and she thought I should know. I was maybe confronted about things by all of them a total of 4 times the whole semester.

Before long, they started having these ""roommate meetings"" where they would sit down and just dish out all of their grievances related only to things about me and nobody else. Most of the things could've been solved if they would have just communicated with me more. They'd overreact about it too. One of them said they cried because I was showering and they needed to use the sink to get in (she literally could have just knocked and the bathroom door doesn't lock). I got really nervous about being in the place I lived. I did my best to fix things they wanted me to fix, but they just kept finding petty things to complain about. I no longer sang in my dorm at all, I would stress-clean constantly to avoid being yelled at. I was always so nice to them despite it all. I would bring them treats. I would uncomfortably spend time with them when I needed to be alone and should have been doing schoolwork. I would go on walks alone around the tiny campus just for an excuse to not be home. I was maybe in the dorm awake for a total of 5 hours or less a day. They got mad at me for never being home.

I reached my breaking point when I overslept one day and missed work because they were all up late being loud the night before when I needed to work at 8:30 the next morning. I woke up and texted the groupchat since I didn't know who was home about maybe halfing the volume on the TV past midnight and they threw the biggest hissy fit about it and complained about me loudly in the next room before they left for class because they thought I wasn't home. I was so shaken up that I bawled, got it together, lasted maybe half my next class (the one I'm failing), then left. I didn't know where to go. I felt like a failure somehow for being a terrible roommate.

I had a meeting with my RA about it that night because I wanted to move out so I would no longer be a problem for these girls, and he reassured me that most of this wasn't even my fault and that my roommates are treating me like garbage. There was maybe one thing I discussed with him that would be remotely considered something to complain about. When we had our collective meeting, they still tried to demonize me and even claimed that they never said what they did about me beforehand, suggesting it was the upstairs neighbors. We live below the RA. They all pretended to be nice to me and told me they wanted me around and consistently still did not show that.

4 meetings with the Residence Director later, I was matched with a new set of girls. However, they had a party lifestyle, kept things in the room that could get them in serious trouble, and were quick to turn on me. I told the RD that I felt these girls would be a worse fit and she cancelled the room change. She told me there is nowhere for me to go until next semester.

After another bs ""roommate meeting,"" which they blatantly asked when I was moving out as the first question, I decided the answer was that night, and packed enough clothes for the next week plus other necessities. I totally cut off communication with my roommates because I didn't want to say things I didn't mean. They were nice at first but wouldn't leave me alone, trying to apologize and ask if I was okay and then on Wednesday one of them posted a pic of them giving the middle finger to the camera with the caption ""you know who you are b\*tch."" I screenshotted it and blocked her. Thought, ""Yep. That checks out."" It's pretty on-brand behavior for them.

 I moved everything out that I owned on Thanksgiving and I am now living at home again.

&amp;#x200B;

**Relationships/Social Life**

Another thing they got me into were dating apps. I had an overwhelming crush on someone at the start of the year who did not like me back. We decided to stay friends, then I was glad I didn't date him. Since I hadn't had any luck, I decided what the heck? I'll give it a try! I met a guy who was graduating after next semester who I really liked. I almost lost my virginity to him, but I'm glad I decided not to, because he was looking for something casual, while I was looking for something more serious. He would tell me ""I don't want to hurt you,"" all the time when I would spend time with him. I didn't know what that meant until he slowly broke away from me. 

To complicate things further, I opened up to my counselor about how I felt I could be attracted to pretty much anyone, and how I also didn't feel like a girl, I am not a fan of my feminine body, and how I felt more comfortable in androgynous clothing. I am still trying to get comfortable with both. I am not out yet, but she suggested going to the out-group on campus which is the LGBTQ+ alliance to meet more people like me, but I was kind of nervous and also didn't have the time, so I never went.

The friend I was previously referring to was pretty overwhelming. We connected over our ADHD (well mine at the time was only suspected).  After I found out he didn't like me back, I connected with the other girl he led on. She was great, but was never there when you needed her, always with her boyfriend. She made really poor decisions and one of them cost me a possible good grade on the class I needed to do better in (calculus I) and a day of work. I feared for her safety and wouldn't sleep until I knew she was okay. The issue was resolved by the morning.

With the guy, I finally found like someone understood my life experience. We would talk constantly and formed a codependent relationship with one another. There was never a time when he wasn't on his phone either, so I just got stuck in this texting black hole with him all the time. It was like we were both addicted to talking to each other and leaning on one another for the mini-crises we were experiencing. I decided to cut him off last week after he laughed about putting a girl that liked him back in a tough situation by forcing himself upon her. I always thought maybe he was a bit of a hypersexual creep. We had an argument over whether or not it was okay to show emotions and him thinking he didn't need counseling I friendly suggested to him to possibly help with his paranoia, never feeling like he deserved to be happy, and impulsive decisions that hurt others. He said that my way of processing things, crying to feel the emotion and then moving on with a course of action, was ""f\*cking pitiful"" and that it made me a ""headcase"" and a ""mess."" I would try to break away from him all the time but always ended up coming back for reasons I couldn't figure out. I thanked him for finally giving me a good reason to leave and he said some garbage about how he will see my face in his dreams and weep in his sleep or some weird sh\*t like that. I didn't look back after that. Now I am really lonely and so behind in homework that I couldn't join any clubs so I don't socialize with anybody anymore. 

On top of all of this, my family was having a hard time dealing with the fact that I wanted to stay an entire week at school without coming home, that I couldn't help them with homework anymore, and that I was making decisions they could no longer control. Thankfully, as always, ended up being supportive in the end.

&amp;#x200B;

**Academics**

My academics are a mess and it first started because I thought I could handle two jobs and a full course load. Thankfully, my school gave out enough need-based grant money to where I could quit the other. As if everything else in my life wasn't awesome enough(/s), I started to really struggle with executive functioning. My laundry and homework weren't getting done and I barely remembered to eat. Sometimes I would doom scroll on my phone so much that I would end up finally freeing myself to shower that the inconvenient time of 3am. I felt like I was putting as much energy into surviving as I did into extracurriculars. I am now in the same position as last year where I am scrambling to save everything last minute, going to the tutoring center constantly, but it still doesn't feel like enough. I have deleted social media and I'm trying to really crack down on my stuff now that I'm medicated. I was given antidepressants though because I have anxiety and I was also anxious about going on stimulants because even a little bit of coffee makes my body just go absolutely nuts. They help me get out of bed, but I still have a terrible time concentrating on what I need to do, but I have a great time concentrating on what I want to do! 

I have talked to my other professors in the other classes I was struggling in to help get me to where I need to be, but haven't yet to my calculus professor whose class I am terribly failing and honestly haven't done much to help myself. I have been trying to put out so many fires all year that I barely had time to do the 40 homework problems assigned to us every class. I don't think I finished any of the assignments. Thankfully, yet also unfortunately, those aren't graded at all. My friends and family were so dependent on me that I was on my phone most of the class because I hadn't learned the value of boundaries yet (that I know now), so all of my notes looked like scribbled, incomprehensible nonsense. I have been to the tutoring center four times total, mostly right before exams, and it was helpful in understanding the topic, but not for doing super well on the exam itself since it's all pulled from the homework. It was difficult being in writing-intensive, homework-intensive, and project-intensive classes all at the same time my life decided to crash into me like a semi. I didn't know that I should have scheduled the first semester a little easier for myself, but to be fair, I didn't have a clue what these classes would be like. I guess I don't know how to approach asking this professor for help at the end of the semester, knowing I have not done much to help myself.

I have a scholarship where I have to maintain a 3.25 GPA per semester to keep it that I am worried I will lose since it seems I have to pass all of my classes this semester for that to happen and I am currently failing one and severely behind in another. I am still confused about the terms of the scholarship because I already paid my school bill for the next semester. Will they not renew it next year because of this fall semester? I am so lost with it. Financial aid hasn't really given me a great explanation about it. I am wondering if I can petition to keep it, especially since I found out that I have ADHD, which played a part in the reason why I was struggling in my classes and honestly just in general. I am working on getting accommodations for it anyway so they'll have the paperwork to know I'm not fibbing.

&amp;#x200B;

**Major Change**

I am also changing my major because I was interested in computer science in high school because I was young, stupid, and wanted to impress a senior. That senior ended up grooming me throughout the entirety of the time I was in high school and said he didn't want to be in a relationship with me once I finally got to be of legal age. I was taken advantage of during high school (I'll spare you the details) and didn't even know it. I didn't realize that wanting to impress him was the driving force behind my interest and that it was even grooming at all until a few weeks ago when I was sitting around wondering why I was even majoring in CS if I didn't like programming in the first place, despite all the awards I won for it in high school. I got really emotional about it, so I wrote a poem (like I do to process most of my emotions) and realized what happened.

&amp;#x200B;

I love genetics, so I am changing my major to molecular biology/biomedical sciences. I was interested in the genetic counseling career because I obviously have a knack for supporting people through heavy subjects as the therapist friend, I liked the fact that I could also educate people since I originally wanted to change to an education major, and that I could take a TON of science courses, which I love. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Friend Suggestion:**

My friend recommended dropping out of the school I love to go to community college. Even though I don't see any shame in it in general, I feel like I worked so hard to be at the school I'm at right now on the terms I am there. Everyone was so proud of me for getting my school paid for/escaping massive debt and I feel like I would just be letting those people down by leaving that. Not to mention, I like having my own space and simply cannot afford an apartment right now. The CC near me does not have housing. I really want to make my situation work.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:**

I had roommate issues so bad that I had to move out of my space I pay for on-campus two days ago, thought I could balance 32 hours of work but could not so I had to quit one of my jobs, toxic friendships keeping me from meeting anyone new, discovered Tinder (didn't go super well), identity and trauma revelations leading me to a major change from cs to biology in hopes of maybe becoming a genetic counselor, issues related to being the first child to ""leave the nest"" and my family having a hard time with it, a VERY RECENT ADHD diagnosis, failing two classes and don't know how to approach a professor whose class I have done little to help myself in but need to simply just pass, and nervous about losing the full-tuition scholarship that is keeping me here for a little over $1k a semester (evaluated by semester), and my friend recommended community college (but even though I don't see any shame in it I feel like I worked so hard and would just be letting people down, not to mention I liked having my own space and simply cannot afford an apartment right now). I'm just wondering what suggestions you guys have for me, especially with the one class I was talking about and aspirations for grad school.

&amp;#x200B;

Everything is falling apart but also slowly falling into place? I guess I am just super lost in general and looking for a little commiseration/advice. I really want to continue do better, I just don't know what else to do.",5,1,vividvibrantladybug
134,r1kjam,2021-11-25 01:28:51,CollegeRant,homesick as a sophmore,"last year, i stayed home to do online classes rather than going to campus. my school actually encouraged us to stay home. i saved money and got to skip the dorm life. at first i was sad, but i really did enjoy being home for the extra year. it was almost like taking a leap year but still having classes. i managed the classes well but still was able to have freedom etc. i got involved in clubs and even attended virtual events and won some prizes etc. my best friend stayed home too and some other friends as well. for the most part, i had a very good online college experience and i’m grateful. however, i couldn’t wait to get an apartment and go to campus for sophmore year. i wanted to meet new friends, party, and have fun. 


now that i am here at school, i miss last year so much. it really is a case of ‘enjoy it while they last’. staying home last year gave me so much time to work on my mental health (which i really needed) and also allowed me to get closer with my parents and mature. our relationships got much better and i felt like an adult despite still being at home. i also like my town and how close it is to the city and other things, which is the complete opposite my college town. at home i could truly focus on my studies and other hobbies i wanted to pursue. 

at school, i feel trapped. its hard to get peace and quiet despite living in an apartment. i constantly feel bad for the nights i dont want to go party with my roommates. i feel like i’m not pursing any actual hobbies because all i do is come home from class and watch tiktoks. i dont have the motivation to do anything else because i’m so drained from class and dealing with my three roommates 24/7. i miss my parents, i miss driving their car, i miss my job, and i miss having time to do things i want. 

i also feel like despite my classes being online last year that my classes were actually better last year than this year. my professors were better and seemed to care more.

don’t get me wrong, i am still super grateful for the experiences i’ve had at college so far. i’ve had some fun nights partying, i like my roommates, i have made some friends, and even met my boyfriend. i like being on campus but i am just tired and burnt out. i also have anxiety and its been worse. i truly miss home.i miss my parents. i am on thanksigivng break now and i wish i did not have to go back. i can finally feel relaxed. 

i hope it gets better and i can feel happier and less homesick.",4,1,reveluvs
135,r0vhvd,2021-11-24 03:42:28,CollegeRant,My experiences with academic software,"  Dear People of this sub:

To start, I am a nonbinary bespectacled nearsighted autistic college student with ADHD and other stuff (including dysgraphia, central heterochromia in one eye and 50/50 sectoral heterochromia in the other, as well as dyslexia) who was a senior in American High-school immediately before the COVID-19 pandemic in a very large state. In all my years of online education (I had some back in 5th through 7th grade), I have used many types and providers of horrendous online learning, and in my public school days much of the classroom software used was equally horrendous. When I say “horrendous”, I mean that: 

A: said software was/is extremely glitchy in ways ranging from assignments that didn’t even work in an 𝘐𝘛 course (Cengage MindTap, my current college software), ones in the course that did not work until the last day you could do them (also Cengage MindTap), provided system monitoring software that literally hung my ASUS ZenBook Pro Duo when trying to get a reading (also in that course), Proctoring software (Proctorio, a software with ableist and racist algorithms, also currently in my college experience) that after asking you to turn off your ASUS ZenBook Pro Duo double monitor would glitch it after you finished the assignment and made a restart needed afterwards, as well as yearbook software (Herff Jones/hjedesign) that used Adobe Flash into 2020 and never made an HTML5 version in time for the January 12th 2021 Adobe Flash timebomb. And then there’s Kahoot and Quizziz, which essentially only reward people with fast digital and fast physical response times, and an unfortunate layer to this is that teachers actually 𝙜𝙧𝙖𝙙𝙚𝙙 that in a way that was bad for my grade. Then there is iReady, a testing software that was very unstable and barely-functional in ways that included but were not limited to random exits on fast internet. Many of these have/had zero hope of working on Linux even with Wine, and some college classes of mine outright told Mac users to drop the class. For context, I grew up in an all-Apple family. Another horrendous piece of educational software was Microsoft Teams, which barely worked, and it did not work on my machine at the time that properly ran Zoom. Teams even downscaled video assignments, making the details unrecognizable, and they were 𝙥𝙧𝙚-recorded. I also had Schoology, FalconLearning, and PowerSchool, all of which were nonfunctional and desynced, not to mention that they were clunky and unintuitive. Google Classroom would also fail to synchronize with Schoology and PowerSchool, and I remember a pre-calculus textbook that had QR codes to the actual assignments. In addition to the issues with learning platforms, the web-filters were equally problematic, because they blocked the wrong stuff. When I was in grade school, two second graders (age 7) managed to browse RedTube (a porn site) on my elementary school’s Barracuda Web Filter-protected computers. Also, my high school blocked Weebly, which actually hosted the website for the history teacher I had. So not only do we have overzealous filtering of the wrong “contraband”, but we also have educational software platforms that purport to be robust but in truth have glitches so bad that they become unusable or discriminatory to users who are less fortunate in any way compared to “average” students. AI also worsens all of these, because it results in far more false positives akin to YouTube’s bots. There are also YouTube lectures given to students whose school computers ironically block YouTube, a fate I have experienced, so if you don’t have a PC at home it can become impossible for you to do the assignments if there is no library or Internet café near you. 

B: Extremely ambiguous in ways ranging from mathematical software which does not agree on what a decimal should round to (AP and SAT online exams, plus CompassLearning/Odyssey and APEX/ALVS, among others, such as CAASSP \[California state tests\]), to fill-in-the-blank boxes that erroneously bug the right answer by virtue of accepting a non-ASCII em dash instead of the hyphen that is typeable on American keyboards for example, to mathematical assignments that rely on having a resolution higher than that of school-sized tablet PCs, thus making it a game of chance as to whether an assignment would be possible, to the use of monochrome printers and copiers with no enlarge or greyscale function for every single assignment, thus making graphing assignments from the textbook impossible given the fact that my dysgraphia makes it so I can’t properly 𝙙𝙧𝙖𝙬 the graphs, and my dyslexia makes me often skip a cell, thus resulting in equal failures. For me, the graphing unit was an automatic grade dock, even with my TI-89 Titanium (allowed on SAT but not ACT, a test I never took.) This also made plenty of other assignments more wonky because colored text would be unreadable under some conditions, thus making 𝙞𝙣𝙨𝙩𝙧𝙪𝙘𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣𝙨 and other critical stuff hard to read, and keep in mind that I’m nearsighted. This also caused issues for projected assignments, especially because my school’s projectors would off themselves and only output a tinted monochrome image (all-pink or all-green), thus creating similar results to the copier bugs. On Zoom in my college music class office hours, the audio was very clipped no matter what the professor did because ConferZoom (formal educational and corporate Zoom, in this case my college’s flavor) didn’t default to not crunching the screen-share audio. It’s generally a bad idea to treat a system’s soundcard audio output as universally speech. This also caused issues with pre-recorded college lectures. Secondly, the ScanTron (bubbled letter test sheets) system was something that caused me issues because of my tremor-induced dysgraphia that made bleeding into a second bubble very easy, and my dyslexia had at several points caused me to offset every subsequent answer by one dot due to question 11’s answer being in question 10’s slot for example, thus failing a large portion of the exam. The inconsistency of spell-checkers also is a problem, because for courses on modern material that have written portions with misspelling penalties, getting docked just for following the essay prompt has happened to me. There’s also issues with foreign language classes that involve similar spell-check conflicts as well as issues with non-ASCII symbols. As someone who has written code that deals in non-ASCII it’s not best practice to pretend that Unicode does not exist. Word could auto-ligate your text via Unicode, thus words with fl in them could be non-Unicode to a parser. My last name would similarly be affected, as would my deadname’s middle name. In coding assignments for stuff like AP Computer Science, I’ve faced situations in which you bubble in your code letter-by-letter, which is as wonky as you would expect, and that’s just the tip of the code assignment iceberg. One of many issues is that with dysgraphia and/or dyslexia it can be messy due to the offset issue. There are also situations in AP in which you have to record yourself and depending on your machine quality it can be garbage, so people in lower financial ladders can essentially fail a major portion of a foreign language test. Also with Han unification, Chinese class can be problematic on machines that support “CJK Unified Ideographs” rather than having support for specifically-Chinese characters, thus resulting in a hiccup with character form grading. Thus there is essentially both racism and ableism in school tech infrastructure by virtue of it being centered on monochrome English text for people with basic names. Also other ambiguous ridiculousness like not going into the student’s main grade interface and giving no deadlines (Cengage/MindTap and FalconLearning linking to Canvas), having detail-oriented assignments but with absolutely horrendous image quality that renders it impossible (Cengage/MindTap, in this case circuit boards), horrendous mouse interfaces for interactive assignments (CompassLearning/Odyssey, Cengage/MindTap, SimNET, Kahoot, Quizziz, and more)

C: Invasive and unjust, in ways such as literally recording students’ cameras and rooms as they work, requiring that people not be in the house, and failing people who don’t have cameras, and literally tracking eyes, which as a bespectacled autistic person with tremors, dyslexia, ADHD, OCD, central heterochromia in one eye, and sectoral in another can result in a nightmare (Proctorio), plus plenty of other bad stuff. There’s online testing I’ve used in which losing the connection gets you an automatic zero, even in rural schools, as well as various forms that do not allow for nonbinary gender options when they require your gender for them. 

All of this is really the tip of the iceberg in terms of horrendous educational technology I have used and/or encountered, and it really makes me (a JavaScript developer who wrote the JavaScript implementation of their own file format) feel like there are better ways to do educational software while still being moral, ethical, and practical. I will now list some examples of 𝙜𝙤𝙤𝙙 educational tech I have used. Beepbox is an open-source (MIT License) retro music-making program that is written in JavaScript, and it is used in Australian schools as well as some American ones, because of how intuitive it is to make music with it, while also being soft enough not to be too harsh on speakers. The song is saved in the link to the page (even offline), so that all a student needs to do is submit the link and not have to worry about file uploads. Beepbox is not something that only does harsh tones. It can do light and mellow synth versions of proper instruments as well as rarer and ethnic ones, and it has the ability to import songs you wrote as MIDIs, which can themselves come from guitar tabs. So you could write a guitar song, make it into a tab, then a MIDI, and then import it into the program to make it sound cool. This would be a fun and informative assignment for music class. And by studying and changing the code, programming classes can benefit from this. Then there is Khan Academy, which has very few issues, a motivational goal system, compelling work, and a just way of doing things. Another good example of educational software is Imago, whose quizzes actually function with clarity in their instructions, and another fine piece of educational software is Canvas, which under most cases lays out everything where it matters and has no end of options for instructors and students alike. There is also another good work of educational software known as Remind.me, which has a very succinct and effective way of reminding students of critical events, plus clean integration with Google Classroom and such. It is my hope that these (as well as other software very akin to them), serve as a role model for how to do educational tech properly. To the educational technology I describe as horrendous, I hope that their design be eschewed as soon as possible, instead making the way for software following said role models listed above.

To conclude, educational software is in dire need of refactoring, given that over the past 15 years of my education, the vast majority of educational software I ever used was highly problematic in some way or another (and sometimes bad in multiple ways too). The good educational software I experienced during that time was enjoyable to learn beyond just being my studious self. It is my hope that people in charge of educational software design learn from great educational software rather than subpar educational software. Good educational software would have made education for me so much less stressful in the software aspect of it. I feel like many more students would be inspired to learn more if their educational software was compelling and functional. With that thought said, I finish by saying that accessibility is something that those in charge of designing good educational software should factor into their choices, so that all students can learn to the fullest, and not be left behind or failed by the system, which is an unfortunately-common phenomenon. And with that out of the way, I end this tale.

Sincerely,

A Concerned College Student.  


  
TL;DR: I had plenty of bad experiences over the course of my education with educational software, but the ones I'm enduring this semester of college are the single worst pieces  
 of educational software I ever used.",2,1,stgiga
136,r0mhy8,2021-11-23 20:31:21,CollegeRant,Are you kidding me?,"I’m taking half my classes online and the other half in person. This week I’m off for the two in person classes and one online class. I was supposed to be off for all of them, but this professor decided we would have “extra time” this week, so she didn’t just assign work, she basically doubled the load. 

She sent an email Sunday night telling us all the due dates. She does this thing where you’re only allowed access to quizzes and exams for one day. It makes the class “more like a real class” and it “stops cheating”, at least according to her. Well, this week that quiz is due Thursday. So my thanksgiving is ruined. 

There’s also a discussion post due this week but the instructions are pretty vague. I emailed her about it immediately on Sunday night and she didn’t reply. She has a part in her syllabus where if she doesn’t reply to an email in 24 hours through the online class portal, we should email her to her faculty email address, so that’s exactly what I did this morning. When I sent the email, her auto reply was on…

It was a whole paragraph about how she’s tired and how this semester has been difficult for everyone so she believes we all deserve a break. She’s going to be with friends and family, and she’s going to “forget about work for a week.” She said that she won’t be reading her emails until early next week. 

The last sentence is my favorite: “If you’re a student, expect a response by Wednesday at the earliest.”

How is this even remotely acceptable? Fuck this. Fuck her. Fuck everything. 

TL;DR: Professor doubled the workload during thanksgiving week, assigned a quiz that can only be done on thanksgiving, then she fucked off on vacation for the week.",31,1,MiddleweightMuffin
137,qzb45f,2021-11-22 02:45:36,CollegeRant,productivity,"ok so i have 2.5 hours left to write 10 pages double spaced on some stupid fluffy environmental bs. (i love the environment ofc it's a priority for human survival, but this class sux mad dick) I know that I can do this. I know I should have started earlier. I am not motivated without a pressing deadline. I've heard that other people have this same struggle with motivation/procrastination and productivity. I just really don't like this super isolating way of working. I like to be around people and talk things out. I like when someone checks that I have hit certain progress milestones and makes sure that I'm on track. This helps me sustain productivity throughout a heavy project or assignment. I know this seems very high school. HOWEVER, my college costs upward of $52,000, so I have a right to some personal expectations.   


All of the information presented in this class, I could learn online. Why spend so much money to attend college? For the curation of content, for personalized assistance, for the social accountability that comes with having a professor, and for the shiny degree. Are these expectations met? Fuck no!

I like to compare college to taking a workout class. You could find the exercises on the internet. You could create a regimen for yourself, but the curation of exercises and the pointers and the motivating force of competition, of surveillance add value because this is supposed to be an efficient approach to working out your body. You put the work in, but it's easy because the trainer pays attention, gives you praise, gives you breaks, and accommodates your weaknesses so that you can develop the standard of strength you desire.  


Well, I am trying to work out my mind. I have disengaged professors who do not try to sincerely connect with any of us students. (I'd understand not getting close with everybody, but they don't connect with *anybody.* I'm in my third year, still taking required classes unrelated to my major. There is no personalization in teaching styles. I know this comes across as weird private school entitlement, but this is an idealist's picture of education and I think for $52k+ we should be a bit closer to the ideal than where we currently are. Also, more than half of the students at my school pay full tuition, so it's not a dilution issue. Why isn't my academic experience better?? I WANT IT TO BE BETTER! 200K+ for professors who couldn't give a shit less who their students are??? They are the failed ecologists that passed down environmental burdens to us! Fuck them. They are not trying. I know this is harsh, but it's a harsh price tag. Maybe they aren't getting paid enough to care. That's probably the case. I don't know their salaries. There is serious mismanagement of funds and of hiring. 

TL;DR  professors should be more hands on. i don't work well alone.",7,1,cbdinfusedcocaine

My semester hasn't been going great. I have two outstanding assignments right now that were both due on Tuesday. On Wednesday I was supposed to give a presentation, but it got bumped because I hadn't handed the slide deck in on time (I started putting it together on the day of the presentation, and probably could have delivered a mediocre presentation). These assignments were all due after a short break, but I had intended to have them done before the break so that I could relax during the break.

I actually had three assignments due on Tuesday, and I did one of them, and did 60% of another one. I had Monday off, but I barely did anything on Monday. I missed the past three assignments in one of my classes, and haven't been handing in small pass-fail assignments in another class (meant to show that I've done the readings, which I haven't been doing since the midterm). Almost all of my assignments have been handed in late, some two weeks late. I don't think I'm failing any classes yet, but my performance is abysmal.

I'm in my junior year. I wasn't the best last year, since online classes weren't my thing, but I did a lot better than this. My self-discipline and motivation seem to be completely gone. I don't think I'm burned out or depressed or anything, but I'm trying to book a counselling appointment just in case. My freshman year I got an A+ in every class but one, and last year I only had one C. And I worked part time while I was doing it--this is my first time in two years not working. I saved up enough money (with the help of CERB, not gonna lie) to be able to afford my junior and senior years without having to work part time anymore.

I just want to pass this semester and get a fresh start in January. I have the ability to be an A student again, and I want to be doing well, but my behavior is completely at odds with what I want. I was depressed for parts of high school, and my behavior was similar, but I don't feel mentally ill at present. 

TL;DR I feel good like I did my freshman year, but my motivation and self-discipline are gone, and I'm not longer feeling pressure to meet deadlines--I don't get it.",2,1,SavCItalianStallion
139,qxyrwm,2021-11-20 05:32:33,CollegeRant,Why are professors allowed to assign any work during a break?,"It's not every professor, but it's at least one every semester. Fall/Spring break comes around, and I can't get just ONE WEEK without a professor assigning something during it. It's happened in most of my semesters starting from high school. There's always that one teacher, and it keeps happening in college. Most of the time, there aren't any assignments due *during* the break, but they're due *the day immediately following the break*, so if I can't get it done in 1 day, I'd have to work on it during the break. The few teachers that have commented on this have said ""work on it now, so you won't have to work on it during your break"".

**JUST MAKE IT DUE BEFORE THE BREAK! WHY CAN'T YOU RESPECT MY BREAK?!**

Thankfully, it's usually not an assignment that we didn't know about ahead of time, but why are they even allowed to assign work during the break? In my last two semesters, I've had a professor assign work that was actually DUE during the break, which I didn't even know was allowed.

It's a break off from coming to class, but if all of my classes are online and I'm not going to an in-person class anyway, then I'm not even getting that benefit.",14,1,Net56

I was in welding for a hot minute before I jumped out of that pile of trash only to jump into a damn dumpster full of used condoms and needles. 


Had two welding teachers, one was good but had to make up for the other ones slack so it still was lacking a lot. The other teacher in welding couldn't fucking weld if he had to and was a prick about anything and spent all his time with the older students he knew. I left that class because the only thing I'd been taught was how to weld in a straight line and my bad teacher, which was my main one wouldn't check our welds or even tell us how to set up the welding rig. So I left that class for mechatronics hoping it's be better, it had to be right?

Nope, mechatronics was just as bad as welding. Actually mechatronics was worst because in my welding class I did learn a new skill, welding. It ain't great or pretty but I can weld and can do it good if it's the type that runs the wire through the hose, and yeah I don't know what kind that's called. Anyways though I didn't learn anything in mechatronics, literally anything. My teacher would talk about his time in the service and he'd describe how in one instance his squadmate used a plastic more spoon to kill an ambusher. Sure it's cool and I enjoyed his stories, especially the graphic ones, but I was there to learn about mechatronics not about his kills and theft from the military and his family. Seriously I can tell you more about his military career and family than I could mechatronics, which I couldn't tell you anything about mechatronics.

TLDR: My tech school sucks and if I had to go back for anything it'd be Mechanics because my buddies are in there and they're having a kick ass time, plus the teacher looks like santa.

I know nobody gives a shit but I did fully drop out and am working on finding a job from home so I can work however much I want/need to pay for my next college experience. My next college experience is gonna be fully online in programming or coding, I plan on doing history eventually but not yet cause it's hard to find a job that'll hire a history major.

145,qup7j8,2021-11-15 20:10:43,CollegeRant,Worst semester ever due to incompetent professors,"Since rate my professor only gives you 120 characters to describe how awful your professors are, I decided to take out all my anger on Reddit. My apologies. 

I’m in my second to last semester and will be graduating Spring of 2022. I’ve never had a problem with professors like this before, and Ive always had a least 2-3 favorites out of 5 each semester. However, this semester it seems like I got every worst professor at my school. Firstly, my microeconomics professor is terrible. This class is 100% online with no meeting so we just get assigned weekly work. He was extremely confusing in the beginning, had no clear due dates, had weekly modules but would change the dates without notifying, doesn’t communicate over email at all so I almost missed the midterm cause I had no idea it was posted on Blackboard. He sent out an angry announcement to the entire class threatening that some people will fail cause “some of you” turned in the quiz late. He wasn’t specific at all and it made everyone in the class panic. There’s been a few weeks where I would check for the weekly assignments on Monday Tuesday or Wednesday and nothing would be posted until late on Thursday or Friday with no announcements and they would still be expected to be turned in that Sunday (weekly work was due every Sunday). And that’s just one of my professors. 

My marketing professor quite literally has two brain cells. Her class is also 100% online with weekly work and this has got to be one of the most confusing classes I’ve ever taken. Very similar to the previous Professor I discussed, she was unclear on due dates. She formatted the syllabus into an interactive PowerPoint which made it very difficult to quickly find important information about the course. She would randomly move due dates around, was horrible with communication. And on top of this, her workload for a 200 level class is insane. It’s easy work, just very long and tedious. Here’s a weekly example: 
 2 hour long reading + questions 
Chapter homework 
Chapter quiz 
4-5 videos to watch + questions 
Journal entry 
And this was only PER chapter. Sometimes she would have 2 chapters due within the same week. We now have to also post weekly flipgrid videos responding to a discussion question that the STUDENTS have to make up. She also now randomly posts lectures but they are optional thank the Lord. One student actually called her out over email and cc’d the dean of the university but I don’t think anything was done. 

This next Professor creates a type of rage in me I’ve never felt before for another human being. She’s very clueless but also an extreme hardo and so anal when it comes to the technicality of an assignment. I got 30’s and 40’s on assignments I completely understood, I just formatted them wrong. What makes it worse is that this is a ONE CREDIT COURSE. It’s supposed to be a lab for accounting. As far as my regular accouting class I’m doing great; got a 100 on the last exam and love the professor (the only one I like and respect). However in order to pass regular accounting I need to pass this extra 1 hour lab practice with this menace of a professor. She doesn’t even teach during the one hour we have her, she assigns weekly work that is impossible to do without asking help from a peer leader. If you miss one assignment she fails you for the course, and since this is a pass/no pass if you get below a 70 you fail. I currently have a 73 in the class and over the weekend she sent me a warning email basically saying that I may not pass the course. Pretty bold of her to say since she has yet to even teach one lecture. I’m seriously considering going to the dean about her. Today I overheard her talking with a student from a different class and from what I could hear I guess the student missed an exam due to a sudden emergency and he was trying to work with her to figure out how he can make up this exam. She basically said she doesn’t do make up exams and he asked if he was getting a zero and she was just dancing in  circles around his question basically answering like a politician. I feel so bad for him. She said in order to conduct a make up exam she would need something in writing from the University. F$!k you!

This next Professor isn’t too bad, his methods of teaching is just terrible. He’s a nice and chill guy, but treats his college students like middle schoolers. 20% of the class is him lecturing, but the other 80% of the class is being put into small groups to answer a discussion question together and come up with solutions. However, these discussion questions are a complete joke. One question asked which five items we would bring to a deserted island, and another one asked us how to make the workplace more diverse. Just a very simple minded questions that fifth graders could answer. He gives out three quizzes a semester and they are all based on the text book and don’t relate to anything we do in class, so unless you memorize the textbook it’s very hard to get a good grade on those quizzes. A few months ago we had a written assignment where we had to take a quiz to see how compatible we are to work in management and the paper was very subjective/reflective and purely opinion based. Even though I followed all the criteria, exceeded the word requirement, and had no grammar mistakes I got an 87. I emailed him asking why I received an 87 for a subjective/opinion based paper especially since I followed all the criteria and he emailed me back apologizing and gave me a 92 instead. Even though I’m very appreciative of him changing my grade I still don’t understand why I lost points for and I honestly think I should’ve gotten a 100. Again he’s a very nice and chill guy but you don’t learn a thing in his class.

This last professor just makes me question how some people passed grade. He was so insanely strict about masks that he Took 10 minutes out of the first day of class to demonstrate how to properly drink from a water bottle while wearing one. Like are we serious? He would call people out immediately if someone’s mask accidentally slipped under their nose. The worst part is that he didn’t use blackboard to post assignments and course content. He made us buy a whole separate website where he said he posted all course materials. Halfway through the semester we’ve yet to receive one assignment and every single class which was an hour and 15 minutes was just him rambling and rambling on about the same things that we already learned. Yes not having any assignments was nice, but if I paid $100 for a whole separate website at least make it worth it. I actually withdrew from this class a few weeks ago because it was so effing pointless and a waste of time and money. 

TL;DR my professors this semester are the worst of the worst and I go into detail of what makes them so awful.",8,1,purple_spatula14

I’m working towards an A.S. at a community college with two semesters to go before transferring to university. I‘ve honestly had amazing professors here who seem to truly care about their students and teaching their classes, but it annoys me that there’s so little I can do to really connect with them aside from sending friendly emails from time to time. I’ve always been a “friends with the teacher” type, lol. My Intro to Anatomy professor is delightful - we do Kahoot to start class and it’s literally the highlight of my week (if that tells you how sad my life is lol) - and I sent her some of my sketch studies from Netter diagrams with a little “hey I want you to know I appreciate and am having fun in your class” note. Sharing them that way made me feel like a try hard, but I wouldn’t think twice if I’d done it in person. It’s different to email, you know how it is.

Not gonna spend too much time ruminating on losing out on meeting peers and really talking to them, but we did breakout rooms once in that class, and it felt strange to be so happy about hearing people’s voices and getting to joke around a little with classmates like I haven’t been able to since late 2019. It‘s miserable how apart we all are, and I’m sort of a loner but I didn’t realize how much classes that feel this empty would drain me.

It’s difficult to know how well I’m actually retaining information when the most I can do in any class is occasionally type answers into the chat. My laptop is ten years old. Last time I tried to turn on my mic and camera it broke Blackboard so badly that I had to restart my laptop completely, so I can’t even show up in that way, even though I’d like to. With quizzes and homework assignments for my science courses, it sometimes feels like I’m cramming everything from the chapter into a sieve that it all promptly dribbles out of as soon as the grade goes in. 

I’m starting to lose the motivation I was lucky to have found in the first place, but I’m doing all I can to keep it. C*vid news never stops being depressing and it seems like we’re in for a hard winter. I got my second shot way back in May and from what I understand I’m due for a booster, but I’m distance learning indefinitely anyway to limit the spread, I guess.

The teacher assigns a chapter of the textbook weekly, which is normal. But on top of that, she’s had us read 3 novels at a super-fast pace. I enjoy reading, even textbooks, and that’s never been my source of frustration in a class before. This last novel we are reading is driving me insane because so far every chapter covers the same things that have been covered by either the textbook or other two novels, and it’s way wordier and hard to focus on. The author keeps repeating herself.

On top of that, her grading criteria are really confusing. She takes off points for requirements she didn’t specify (I once got points off for not mentioning a character from a novel by name when the question wasn’t even directly about the novel, even though I did reference a character and just didn’t use his name, for example). She takes off extra points from our 4 essays if we make the same “mistake” more than once, but doesn’t give specific information on what our mistakes were. I got extra points docked for not having my reference formatted correctly, and when I sent it to the writing tutors they said it was correct for the formatting. I was docked in one essay for having too much summary and not enough of my opinion, and in the next for the opposite when I tried to lean the other way. 

I emailed her earlier in the semester about the unclear rubric for our discussion posts, not in a rude way, I just said something wasn’t clear and suggested making it clearer for future assignments. I didn’t even ask for points back. I’ve never gotten a response to any of my emails or comments. There’s just so much reading and writing in this class compared to every class I’ve taken before (4th year). It’s online which I’m used to, but she doesn’t post lectures or share videos or anything.

All of the university in my province are going to have winter 2022 semester in face-to-face since the government lifted pretty much all of restrictions for schools except from mask mandate. In your august 2021 e-mail, the administration of \[university\] informed us that looking for an apartment in the city you are situated in because winter semester was going to be face-to-face.   


I trusted you. As the idiot I am, I packed my stuff and moved 4 hours from home, alone in one apartment with my cat. I tried convincing myself that I would be just fine if I could go to the gym and walk in the city, even if the fall semester was all online. I find it incredibly hard : there are days I am completely not speaking a single word other that the five words I will exchange when I get to the sport pavillon to get my ticket for the pool. There has not been a single day I did not regret choosing to move to your build-up, concrete, driver-based, noisy city. My life is incredibly lonely.  


Today, the news felt that in my department : two classes are given face to face and they are not classes I will actually follow (since I only have three classes left to follow, I am picking the one I want to work in). So here I am, crying because I have never felt as lonely.   


I am paying rent for an apartment I hate, to live in a city I hate, without having had a single  meaningful conversation with anyone in my program and it is because of the administration at \[University\]. And I have to listen to some of your professor explaining that online classes are the best thing ever when they are bringing me (a definite autistic introvert) into a state of despair I have rarely felt. I am angry, screaming and so sad because I feel like my despair is not hear. Most people in my program live with close ones (partner, children, family, friend...) and I have not talk to someone face to face since the lecture week when I went back home for a week. and I don't know if I can ""hold on"" until the semester is over to socialize more than the exchange I have at the grocery with my cashier.

The current plan is to transfer to a university and get a bachelors in software engineering and I want to be a full stack developer (a person who knows everything there is to build websites from what they look like to the program running them on the servers) 

I have had a C++ programming class and currently a Java class but what I learned of C++ last year hardly made sense and I didn't necessarily learn it very well and I am now having the same issue with Java which is making me very concerned with my future plan of being full stack developer and what not. It is hard to learn the stuff that matters to me when im burdened with stuff i don't care about like geography or music appreciation and also when you have professors who just throw assignments at you telling you to just read stuff expecting you to figure it all out on your own, being completely useless.

My main concern is just learning the coding languages because I have not encountered any classes that cover data structures and algorithms yet.

SO, as a solution I have thought to just get my associates finished (getting all the nonsense classes that ""make me a well rounded student"" out of the way) so that I would not have any extra classes to worry about while I take a 1 year break between finishing my associates and jumping into a university for a bachelors. During this break I would maximize all the time I could learning a few coding languages so that I would be prepared for university.

This has all been on my mind a lot lately and I thought to get it off my chest and just get some good opinions on it rather than keep it floating in the back of my mind fueling anxiety and stuff. Apologies for the wall of text, I tried to keep it straightforward with enough details to give a good idea of my situation.

tl;dr 
I'm close to finishing my associates where I have not learned any programming languages very well due to difficult conditions, which will be critical in knowing if I'm going to pursue the bachelors/career path I want in the future. I'm not sure what to do about it other than put uni on pause after I finish my associates to take time to relearn them.",2,1,Nolan-2020
153,qplipy,2021-11-08 19:47:37,CollegeRant,I might finally have a research opportunity,"Hey hey everyone, how's it going. I'm feeling a bit like dancing and crying because I finally have what looks like an interview for a potential undergraduate research opportunity.

I almost gave up before I emailed this person, mostly because I've been trying so hard to get in touch with labs and they've been so unresponsive. I'm in my third year and I think part of the issue is that I haven't had a ton of contact with profs (most of my classes have been hybrid or fully online). The bigger part of the issue is that I tanked my gpa in my third semester (trauma to mental breakdown to late withdrawal to barely passing pipeline) and now I'm behind and lower-standing in a program that a lot of people do very well in.

I realized early in the semester that I desperately wanted to be in this lab. The prof who runs the lab teaches one of my favorite classes, and he works in my exact field of interest (he researches drought stress/climate stress in forest ecosystems, I want to research drought/climate stress impact on plant symbionts). I also happen to be in a class TAd by his PI, so I've been reading his papers and studying his work this whole semester.

My advisor always sends this stupid ass prompt we're supposed to send to labs we want to work for (CV, description of background, a few sentences about the research, etc). Because of my shitty transcript this has never worked for me, and I didn't want to blow it this time. I almost didn't email but then I just said fuck it, I'll send a quick message saying I like his work and suggesting that I want to collaborate in a future semester (not an application, just a conversation). He answered! Now we've been talking back and forth and he wants to meet and discuss some opportunities.

I don't want to get my hopes up too high because he could still change his mind. I'm just excited to talk. If anyone has tips they would be so appreciated (I really don't want to ruin this). I'm meeting with him in a week.",1,1,whoontheplanetearth

So I was a sophomore international student in undergrad. For this semester, I have a lab in o chem and due to some issue, I only have one left so I have to take it in other to be able to study other classes in the next semester. 

I never had any experience in the lab due to both my general biol lab and general chem lab being online and I think my professor knows about this. I prepare for my class, do homework, practice quiz and I always arrive on time. But I feel that my professor is kind of annoying when I ask questions related to the experiment. Then last week where the climate start, we did a synthesis, I ask the professor and he answer almost like screaming "" You've gotta learn and do it by yourself"". Then he walks away. I tried to change, I tried to learn but little of this build-up makes me so sad and I don't know what to do. There are times when said straight to my face that ""you are fine with the book but you are bad at practice"". I have to try to understand and hold it for 3 months. Even when I email him and said that he did not open the link on turn it in to let me turn in my discussion, he ignore me. but on the class day, other students said it and he do it immediately. 

Can you please tell me what to do or give me any advice about this? I'm I wrong in this?",10,1,monicami421

I do my homework 2-3 days in advanced from the due date, but It's so enjoyable when they assign projects, along with 3 homework assignments due on the same date. I might not have good time management, but for someone who does this for a living and for years I would think that they would have it down by now. It's not fun having to do a single assignment that takes 2 hours, then do the quiz and do 2 more of those then the project. There's only 24 hours in a day, I'm up for about 12 of them, I have things to do outside of classes. I understand homework is there for me to fully learn and understand the topic. But the only thing I'm learning is how to spend my whole day cooped in my room doing a homework assignment that you're not going to grade because it was online and they automatically grade it for you. I pay for the homework and the books so that I can learn, not mindlessly sit there and answer questions repeated over and over again.

I was initially supposed to be a division one rower at a private college where I met my boyfriend, didn’t work out financially with my parents so I had to end up leaving that all for a last minute community college registration. 

I’m simply taking prerequisites right now so I can enter Radiology Technology. I’m currently excelling in my Composition II and General Psychology courses, but absolutely bombing CHEM110 and College Algebra. The thing with algebra, I get the content, I understand it, but the way it’s taught is eating me alive. 

We just had a chapter test today which I majorly bombed with a lot of shock. I did the review last night which does allow re-doing of questions, and landed myself a 91%. Basically, my professor teaches every class as a section of the chapter, then we get homework. So imagine learning eight chapters over a course of a month, including one cancelled class, and having a unit test. It’s impossible for me to memorize anything without looking it up for a refresher. I was so confident I’d do better this time and I absolutely killed it instead. I currently have a 67% according to Pearson Portal, zero grades have been submitted to Blackboard. I emailed the professor after I did terrible on the first test, no response. I emailed him again asking if there’s anything I could do and I’m reluctant that I’ll get anything. I do every homework and understand content during class. Why am I failing to understand during the tests?

As for Chem, we finish chapters in 1-2 class periods. I just can’t keep up. I spent the whole class writing notes trying to keep up with my professors pace. Our only assignments in that class are Pearson mastering class assignments. They’re given after we finished the chapter and are usually marked as 3+ hours long. They serve little help to me. We are also given worksheets online that we can use to study, I looked at them for this chapter and understand some of the content, but I feel like I’ve been kicked to the curb for the rest.I reached out for help, emailed my school tutoring service, no response from them. I got an answer from my professor but it was simply a “I can help if you have questions, there are many resources” ordeal. I currently have a 68% in that course, my next exam is tomorrow. 


Basically, I’m in copious amounts of stress. I can’t believe this is happening to me, I am in a program at my CC for graduating top 15% of my high school class. I don’t know where I’m going wrong. My math course is online, chem in person. I’m trying my best, I am terrified of failing and being kicked out of my scholarship program. I feel so embarrassed and ashamed of myself. I don’t know what to do, please help. I genuinely feel stupid, none of my mutuals are going through this and are all thriving at college.

All the other colleges around me are back to face-to-face learning again except the one I enrolled in. Not only that, all other majors in *this* college are doing face-to-face learning, except computer science because apparently there are too many students for it to be feasible with Covid. When I was applying, I talked face to face to an administrator, who assured me that classes would **not** be online this year. Guess what, they changed their minds, despite the pandemic situation being *better* than it was (in my country at least) when I heard those words.

The very first lecture I attended had connectivity issues, since then \~half of them have had issues. This Wednesday the professor didn't even start the lecture, and only let us know on Friday that we'd be having a lecture on Saturday to make up for it. I wake up early and join the class only to see the professor can't get his mic to work, so he doesn't hold the lecture. I think whatever, I'll just join group 2 an hour later and view *their* lecture since nobody will care or notice me, but the professor says he won't be holding the lecture for any of the groups today due to the technical problem, so I went back to sleep. Of course when I woke up, I found out the other groups did hold the lecture after all and I missed it.

Of course, all exams will be held physically, so can't wait for that. No one will care that a lot of the lectures were not held at all, or that the professor had to teach the 1.5 hour lecture in 40 minutes because the online classes system was down for the first half of the lecture.

He does have live zoom meetings but they're uploaded online for us to watch at our convenience. I actually heard from another student that he's mad that people don't show up to the lectures, even though it's literally supposed to be an asynchronous class. I haven't attended the lectures but I have watched all the videos on my own time and I even take notes. Is my attention span always at 100%? No, but I really do try to make an honest effort to keep up with the videos.

We had a project due on Wednesday and I asked him a question that morning. His response was pretty dismissive, it was just, ""did you watch the latest lecture? I covered this extensively."" I actually did watch it, but honestly, it's a really hard class and he rambles a lot and sometimes the stuff he says goes in one ear and out the other. So I just replied with ""I did, I'll take another look at the file"" (he uploads the coding files after class along with the videos).

Anyway, cut to the latest lecture, and there's an entire rant in the first minute that's like- ""some of you guys are asking me questions that I've already covered, and I can tell you aren't watching the lectures, and you probably aren't even gonna see this because you're not watching the lectures. If you try to do this your own way you will fail. Maybe what I need to do is not upload the files after class so you're forced to watch the videos."" The last sentence is what makes me think this is 100% about me. Of course, I'm probably not the only student that asked a dumb question, but realistically this is a small class and I asked this question the same day of the zoom meeting.

This is really disheartening because I don't know how I'm supposed to prove that \*yes\* I actually am watching the lectures. I was also gonna ask him for a letter of recommendation because I got an A in his class last semester, but I guess that's out the window now.

174,q6r4v0,2021-10-12 17:21:58,CollegeRant,Lack of online classes for spring,"My major doesn’t require much, I’ll be honest. It’s Communications/Media Production. There’s only one class in my major that we are required to take that actually needs to be in person, which I’m currently taking. The majority of the courses for my major were online pre covid but as I’m looking through the lists for Spring 2022, almost every single one is in person! And at very similar times too. I’ve never had so many issues trying to piece a schedule together. And I only need four major electives and a minor elective (my minor elective will actually be online!) Several of these classes could easily be online. For example: History of Cinema and Social Aspects of Film. You go in, watch a movie, and go home. I took a similar course last winter and it was perfect online. I feel like they’re trying to overcompensate for all the covid stuff, but in reality is just making life a lot harder for people who can’t/don’t want to be on campus six days a week. (My school is mostly a commuter school as well)
There was two classes I really wanted to take but they were at the same time, and only one section for each. Just sucks. They only offer one class at one time and then all the other classes are the exact same way. It’ll be my last semester though and I got it worked out to where I’ll only be on campus three days a week, so not bad. Just needed to complain because online courses made it so much easier for me personally to balance, but I only saw maybe one or two online classes for my major at all when pre covid it was more 50/50.",2,1,computing-depressed

176,q5qegn,2021-10-11 07:10:48,CollegeRant,I hate my stupid college schedule... Why couldn't it be like in high school? Worst schedule possible...,"I really hate college this year and I'm really frustrated with it. While some of it might be because of things that's my own responsibility, like my overall life situation (loneliness and boredom), some because maybe this study isn't the best for me, some of it is absolutely is because of specifically this college's system. So here's some rant specifically towards something that I can't do anything against. I'll also compare it a lot to my high school's schedule to show that this schedule COULD'VE been good

&amp;#x200B;

This is the WORST schedule imaginable! First of all, like last year, I do approximately have 35 hours per week, which translates to 8 hours each day minus half of a day which is free. It's from 8h30 to 18h00, excluding those free hours.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the same as high school. Except, for some reason,now the SCHEDULE CHANGES EVERY DAY! While in our high school, we the same schedule for each week, but now it ALWAYS CHANGES!!!

&amp;#x200B;

(If anyone wants to know, I'm in ""DUT"" in France, which apparently translates to ""community college"" in America. I'm not that sure tho)

&amp;#x200B;

And also, even the 5 hours of free time changes every time! I have to watch every week my schedule not only to view what classes I'll have but also when I won't have classes! Imagine if it would've been in a consistent time tho! I could've make plans for any activity I want! It was ALWAYS Wednesday afternoon for ALL my life! Why change it?

&amp;#x200B;

And also the online classes... Online classes are already bad, but I mean it's not their fault, it's because of the pandemic. What IS their fault however, is having HALF A DAY ONLINE AND HALF A DAY NOT FOR 3 SEPARATE DAYS!!! So very often, I have to commute at lunch to go to school or to home! WHY do this HORRIBLE thing when other schools have just done a very easy thing of 2 days online and 3 days at school? WHY??? No wonder then that I often disregard the schedule completely and just come very late! With this horrible inconsistent schedule!

&amp;#x200B;

Also, even the small things became way worse. For example, the different classrooms. We kinda move back and forth between all the different classrooms. Why tho? They have enough classrooms for all the classes, or at least they could've that we go to one classroom at least most of the time! And it's not like there's anything different in different classrooms, we're in programming, it's all the same and we're mostly always on our PCs! In our high school, we were mainly in our class! And why is this a problem? Of course, for having a good routine (since the lessons AND the classrooms change, I have to check my phone every day since it's always different!). But also, more importantly, it would've mean that I wouldn't have to take my heavy backpack everywhere, including recess and lunch! This would've been SO much better!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR - my schedule in college is very horrible and despite my classes being basically like in high school, the schedule is way worse. It constantly changes, including the free time, classrooms. Also, half of a day is online and I have to commute at lunch.",2,1,throwayaygrtdhredf
177,q5jych,2021-10-11 00:06:02,CollegeRant,Asynchronous classes suck balls. (Sometimes),"In my first year of college, I took a pretty basic, zero-level math class. It was part in person and part online. The professor was really good at explaining things, and I actually got something out of the class. I failed the course (mostly because I went through high school online and had zero study skills), and now I'm retaking it again. This time, I decided to take it online, because hey, I already did this stuff, so it should be easy, right? Nope!

This online course is one of those where the prof. just says ""do problems x through y from the textbook"" and does no actual teaching. There are some ""lecture notes,"" which is weird because there are no lectures. Worse yet, the textbook problems aren't actually graded. It's just assumed that you'll do them and somehow figure it out from the limited, out-of-context information the textbook gives you, and then you'll be ready for each of the seven assignments that actually get graded.",11,1,tyttuutface

The thing is that i have this super hard class, mathematical methods, but my proff its a complete jerk.   
When he gets on the videocall he literally says this: \*sighs\* good morning, and people say good morning to him and he doesnt even says a word back, hes always with this tired voice, you can tell just by his voice that he hates us and that he dont wants to be on class with us. hes always in a bad mood. and its such a throw off, bc he class its boring and he makes it waaaaayyy boring. like he doesnt even tries to show a lil bit excitement for the class. like how fucking rude. i always say hello in a friendly tone even if i feel like crap. so its so rude to me that he fucking sighs to even say hello, i know that it could be a mental problem, but its a job dude, we all know (the ones that have had job) that sometimes you gotta put this mask on and try to give the best of you.

  
I know were college students and we are supposed to me mature but is it that hard to fake your voice just for the sake of making the class more friendly??

179,q27oog,2021-10-05 22:53:01,CollegeRant,My mental health is at an all time low because I can't get into a good grad school,"Post got removed from r/college, so here I am.

I'm not sure if this is how it works everywhere else, but the university I attend has a number of colleges affiliated to it; during examinations, answer scripts are always evaluated externally, that is, by professors of a different college under the same university.

However, since the lockdown started and classes and exams began to be conducted online, our university declared that all answer scripts would be evaluated internally. Professors in all the colleges saw this as an opportunity to give their students a massive boost by evaluating their papers extremely leniently resulting in fantastic CGPAs. 

Well, all professors except the ones at my college. Our professors decided that now was the time to prioritise their ""integrity"" over all else, and graded our papers as strictly as they could, leading to my batchmates and I scoring significantly lesser than students of all the other colleges.

Mind you, it was our final semester and most of us aspired to study at some of the best universities in the country. Our college is also among the top 3 colleges in our state, so our grades shocked everyone (this issue got the attention of the press as well).

Admissions into graduate programmes started In early September, and 99% of the students from my class, including myself, have not been accepted anywhere. Not even into the sub-par institutions in the city.

I had my entire career path meticulously planned out, and this just feels like such an insurmountable roadblock. I know I shouldn't let something like this discourage me, but I can't help it. It's so incredibly frustrating knowing that I deserve to go to a good university but I can't.

My anxiety is at its peak and I've been crying for days on end. Sorry for this essay and sorry if this is not the right sub but I just really had to get this off my chest.",2,2,imokareyouok
180,q230yv,2021-10-05 18:58:36,CollegeRant,"If I could take all online classes, I would b/c professors are useless","Self-teaching doesn't apply to everyone. I know not everybody can teach themselves, but in my case, I wish I could take all online classes so I can teach myself. Sadly, not every class I need to take has an online course. I hate being required to show up to a lecture where I don't even learn anything. It's not until I go on Youtube or some other online resource where I find a clear and concise version of the material. 

Take Calculus I for example. My professor had a lecture on linearization and differentials, and good god I did not understand a single sentence or concept that he explained. As soon as I went home, I watched Professor Leonard and was immediately able to grasp the concept. All I needed to hear was that the differential is the height up to the tangent line. That's it. That's fucking it.

Almost every professor I've had throughout college so far, not just my Calculus teacher, either don't know how to explain concepts or explains them in such an overly complicated manner. The only one who doesn't is my computer science professor. His teaching style is just like Leonard's. He makes everything so clear and simple.",23,34,PatheticPlushie
181,q0vnud,2021-10-04 01:42:01,CollegeRant,I hate having professors walk behind me,"I took an exam last Friday and my professor of course walks around the room to catch cheaters. I sit all the way in the back and I'm almost against the wall. During his walks around the room, he would often stand right where I was seated. Not because I was suspicious but it just helps him see the entire class. I am a SA survivor and it only occurred several months ago and so I hate people behind my back like that. I'm somewhat more comfortable with peers my age but someone older, standing up, puts me into a panic attack. I cried in silence during my exam and I couldn't focus. It was an easy exam but I was just getting so scared and thinking about my SA experience, that I screwed up and failed the exam.   
There's no way of talking to him about it. I haven't been able to talk to anyone but some support groups online about it. I hate that he might think I'm dumb. I just wish he would use a lockdown browser and let me be alone giving me no chance to panic.",6,1,ThrowAwayMyCollegeR

After that I stopped going to school and worked full time for the next year while covid was raging and everyone was online for classes. Got accepted to a state university and enrolled for THEIR gen chem 1 class because needless to say I needed a refresher and was willing to pay for it. After the transfer department reviewed by transfer credits my “advisor” contacts me saying I didn’t need to take chem 1 and to contact him immediately. This was during a longer than usual work shift so because I didn’t answer him within the hour he sends me another message saying “I changed your class to gen chem 2, no worries”. I see this after work and I am mad. That was on a friday so after the weekend and planning to move for college I forgot to call him and argue about it so I figured well it can’t be that bad. The lecture and the lab are two separate classes which ok? I guess I’ve never experienced that but they also don’t communicate with the other to align their lessons?? So in lecture class I’m doing great the prof is wonderful I’m passing. Lab class I’m failing, prof. sucks gives no feedback on anything and pushes all her work on her TA’s.  will probably drop this class soon and take gen chem 1 lab next semester.

188,py4ycz,2021-09-29 21:18:32,CollegeRant,Long assignment with no guidance,"This relates to a previous post I made complaining about a CS project with vague specs. I thought I started early enough to finish it on time, but I didn't. It was much longer than I thought it would be, though I was able to finish it before the ""will not be accepted"" cutoff, so only 10% was taken off.

I had to message the professor about it twice. The first time was asking about a minor ambiguity in the specs, and also how to submit the project, because she never said how. She had to post an announcement to the class with that information after I asked her about it. The second time, I was asking about the late policy, which also wasn't explained anywhere. She had to post another announcement to the class after I asked her about that.

Separately, I had to consult with multiple other students to get a better understanding of what the main function of the  project was supposed to do, and what the output was supposed to look like (there was no example output in the project specs). I would barely have even gotten off the ground if I wasn't on the student community Discord for the department.

Fast forward to today, the professor posts an announcement extending the final late-grade due date and urging students to try for partial credit because several students still hadn't turned it in yet (this is 3 days after it was due, and she posted the project several weeks ahead of time).

On one hand, it's a good story about starting assignments as early as you can. On the other hand, it's a good story about how students ""expect"" to take a certain amount of time on a given assignment. I haven't spent more than about 6 hours on any other CS project this semester, and I've rarely gone over that for projects in the past unless I didn't understand the language I was using (more on that below). This project was deceptively large, since it *looked* like it only had a few steps. Figure out how to build something, print that thing, then do some input validation.

Well, as you might have guessed, I didn't really understand the language I was using. I'd used it before, so I thought I was just rusty. No, I actually just had to use a LOT of different parts of that language that I had literally never seen or heard of before.

If I had just one thing, this all would have gone much smoother. Just one thing. *GUIDANCE.* This was way too big of a project to just throw at the students and then leave them to their own devices. If I wasn't on Discord, I'd probably still be lost, or dropping the class, because the instructor didn't say much of anything to help us out. She mentioned a few things about the output in class (the project is posted and submitted online), and if I remember correctly, what she told us about it was *WRONG!* The output wasn't supposed to look anything like she told us, unless that section of the project specs were wrong. One student asked her about one of the example functions and she didn't even know exactly what it did. One guy I discussed the project with met with her on Zoom multiple times and still wasn't able to complete the full project on time. I was relying very heavily on random internet tutorials for almost every single part of the project, after realizing ""oh, \[\*insert anything here\*\], which is very easy to do in a higher level language, isn't as straightforward in this language"". Very little of it was explained by the professor, even less of it was explained in the project specs.

At the very least, give me a proper warning. Either the professor didn't really have any idea how long this project takes to do for the average student, or she just neglected to tell us. Tell me ""hey, this is going to take a really long time"". Nothing. About 15 minutes loosely skimming over the project specs in class without explaining any part of it, now good luck. 

It took me the better part of a week to get every single little part of this stupid thing done. I don't even really care about the grade anymore, as long as I don't have to take this class again.",2,1,Net56
189,pxxgt0,2021-09-29 15:14:06,CollegeRant,I feel like I don't know anything,"(lowkey an anxiety rant)

For context, I'm a junior in college studying stem. I started taking my major specific classes my sophomore year but I have been struggling to get the content to stick. I feel like part of it is because my foundational knowledge of biology and chemistry, etc. is not very good..? Basically, I went through all of my gen eds memorizing information for the exams and forgetting everything afterwards. I'm really interested in stem research, immunology, and all that jazz but I cannot get through my class material.

I feel like part of it is because of the pandemic and online classes which have completely screwed my entire mental status on studying and doing work. I cannot get anything period. Now, I'm really behind in a lot of my classes and I know I can't push anything off but no matter how hard I try to catch up I feel like I'm always super behind and dumb and don't know anything I should know by this stage of college. My thinking is that I need to go back and review all of the basic stem knowledge I should know and use that to help me now, but I can't really study past stuff and current stuff at the same time because there's only so much time. 

At this point, everything is very very overwhelming for me and I just don't feel like thinking or doing anymore but I can't do that because future endeavors, finding a job, and just everything future. 

I don't really know what I want to get out of this post, but if you have any advice or comments or anything I would really appreciate it. 

TL;DR: a very stressed stem junior in college feeling like they don't know anything they should, can't seem to get work done although interested in stem stuff and is very conflicted about what to do now because they feel behind in everything and they don't really know what they wanted out of this post but felt like they needed to share it",6,1,sleepdiver

prof 1:

teaches on a WHITEBOARD behind him, its hard to see, and literally makes it harder for students to copy ANYTHING. his quizzes and exams are dog shit harder then the hw. he thinks its ok to do that bc he curves everything but why make exams impossiblre and with an average of 33 when you can idk give reasonable questions and not have to curve everything?

&amp;#x200B;

prof 2:

cant teach for shit. literally just throws his powerpoints on the screen, reads them, and literally never answers questions. a student once asked a question and he flat out ignored them. the hw is nothing like whats in class bc he uses an online platform that isnt like whats in class. the students literally teach themselves and we all have to work together on hw or else we have no idea what is going on.

&amp;#x200B;

prof 3:

ABSOLUTE WORST. ego higher then the fucking eiffel tower. he has NO idea how to use D2L and was hired in a scramble bc the old professor couldnt teach the class for some reason. its an INTRO programming class and he treats it like we know coding. He used to teach level 300 CIS courses at a top uni but ""retired"" to work at a cc. he doesnt teach at all either. throws the book up and reads it. we have labs every class and only the same 4 people know what to do bc they have previous CIS knowledge. know what he does? puts us in breakout rooms with 1 of these 4 people and THEY PRACTICALLY TEACH US THE CLASS!KNEJHBD HE DOESNT TEACH IT THE STUDENTS DO. also he CONSTANTLY mixes up labs and quizzes for the class. he teaches an intro to c++ and a intro to java class. Last quiz he gave us the java quiz on accident and literally refused to curve or drop the quiz because ""theyre similar, youre engineers you could have figured it out"". are you insane. youre blaming the students for a quiz we bombed because you gave us the wrong one. I'm reporting him if I dont get an A in the class. Im keeping a folder of EVERYTHING to spill his fucking ass to the dean as soon as the semester ends. He likes me, because im honestly a nice person and try to participate even if i get it wrong. im sick of this dude, oh and his assignments are bullshit. If you dont do exactly like how he wants he has no problem throwing an F at you. I'm so close to dropping this class or reporting him but im already 6 weeks into this shithole of a class dropping it feels dumb. I also have a B+ and if I keep a B ill be happy but im reporting his ass anyways. Oh his rate my professor is also 1/5 :). I also cant even pick my professors because im in a transfer program and they pick them for us.

195,pusbs2,2021-09-24 20:52:26,CollegeRant,Student brags about cheating,"The names used are not their real names, but it will be used to describe the individuals.

Some context: It was an anatomy &amp; physiology lab class. The instructor is a very chill guy (let's call him Sam). The student (let's call him Ethan) is currently in his sophomore year and is in a very competitive nursing program (because he cheated the entire freshman year that was online to have a good gpa). All situations occurred in the class with the instructor there.

In our a&amp;p class, we have to study a question bank of over 400 questions for our first lab exam. Ethan started off with saying ""all the answers \[to the questions\] are on quizlet"". Of course, Sam sounded uncomfortable because he did not respond to him, but looked away from him. Sam jokingly says ""I will tell my other students that all the answers are on quizlet"". It is obvious that teachers would never tell their students to cheat. Later on in class, Sam says that ""he hates cheaters"" and ""knows many nurses that were cheaters"". I immediately dislike Ethan because who the heck admits to cheating in front of the teacher! That was just a few weeks ago.

Just a few days ago, we had the first lab exam. A few minutes before the exam started, this dude Ethan boasts about cheating again, but it was more stupid than the first time. He says, ""This was the first in-person exam that I can never cheat on. I cheated on all my other online classes."" He had this big smile on his face as he was saying it. He was wearing a mask, but you could see the happiness in his eyes and he sounded like he was so proud of himself, just openly confessing that he cheats in school.

To me, he sounded so ridiculous. I understand that it is hard to not cheat in an online environment and that everyone cheats. But, don't confess it to the world that you are a cheater and make yourself proud of it. That is just so stupid. Not only that, but he is in a nursing program, a very competitive one that only accepts 100 students. Basically, he cheated his way in, which is so disappointing because there are those who studied very hard to get a seat in the program, but it was wasted on him. Knowing that he is a cheater, if I was a patient, I would never want him to be my nurse because I will not trust my life on a cheater like him.

tl;dr: A student confesses that he cheats in his classes and was very proud of cheating in his previous online classes and for this current class (anatomy &amp; physiology). As crazy as it sounds, he then goes onto brag about it in class in front of the instructor.",9,1,No_Investigator9293
196,pug0sz,2021-09-24 09:13:24,CollegeRant,Professor is a bitch,"I’m in school at a smaller school for medical lab. I’ve had this professor the past two semesters, but online only. This semester we are face to face and in the lab. 
Last semester online I asked about a problem in the book, end of chapter review (not homework) and she told me to “just ask your classmates” Isn’t it her job to help us? 

So now, next semester in- First day of lab and she rattles off some terms and points to pictures of cells on the wall. This is an eos, this is a baso, this is a neut, ect, like I said just pictures, nothing telling me what they are besides her. I asked her if there was a chart in the book or online she could point me to to help learn. She looks at me and says I just told you what those were. I said I’m very much a visual learner and need to see it multiple times to get it to sink in. She goes, “those are pictures, how much more visual do you need?” I lost it and said yes they are but I don’t know WHAT they are. 

Week or so later we’re looking through the microscopes and I ask her to come by to see what type of cell I’m looking at. She goes, “well what do you THINK you’re looking at?”  I tell her I think it’s a baso. She then says to me, “if you called that a baso in a real lab they would laugh at you”. What kind of teacher says that?! Having the smart mouth I do, I responded well that’s why I’m in school to learn. 

Another girl in class is pretty smart and a lot of us go to her asking for help, the teacher told her to “shut up” Another time the class was talking about genetics and the professor was having trouble getting a point across. A girl corrected her on it, and she says to her “Katie, you’re not that smart” I’m glad I had my mask on because my mouth dropped open! Again who says that to a student?!

Then in the same day, she can be really nice outside of the class. I can see her in her hallway and she’ll compliment me on working hard, and getting good grades. 

I can’t go talk to the head of the program because they are best friends. 

I’ve learned to keep my head down, only speak when spoken to, and keep quiet. 

Any other advice?

198,ptj9xa,2021-09-23 00:09:53,CollegeRant,No Excused Absences,"Starting my senior year of college, my school implemented a no excused absences policy. How absences at my school worked was 3 absences your safe, the 4th you’re knocked down a letter grade, and the 5th you fail the course. The thing is I went to art school, we had 3-5 studio classes a week. We’d often use those 3 absences to catch up on assignments especially during midterms and finals, cause of how long some of them take. This new policy however included medically excused absences. A legal doctor’s note stating by a medical professional that you could not attend class that day would not be accepted. Essentially I could be walking to class fully intending on going to get my education and get hit by a bus on the way, thrown into the hospital for weeks unable to attend class, and it would’ve been counted against me even if I had a note from the hospital explaining my situation. It could be like: “hey, I was trying to go to class, it’s not my fault that bus ran the red light and I had to spend a 6 weeks in a full body cast at the hospital!” This added a whole level of fear and stress on top of our work. My teacher told me once about a student who came to class all scratched up with a bleeding leg, and blood on her hands and underneath her fingernails. My teacher looked at her and asked what happened and why she came to class. She apparently fell on the streets of NYC (which are substantially dirty) and came to class because, and I quote, “I didn’t wanna be marked absent”. My teacher, pissed off by this knowing it was about the policy, marked her present and instantly made her friend who was with her coming into class and when she fell to take her to the ER to get patched up and didn’t want her to come back cause she needed to be safe. This policy angered the rest of the student body and petition (which I signed myself) went around that gained nearly 500 signatures in the first 2 hours. Eventually it made it over 2000 signatures! This, of course, still didn’t budge our administration. The spring semester of 2020, my last semester of college, came around and Covid was a recognized issue spreading through the world. Spring break began on February 28th of 2020, Covid was spreading through Europe and Asia, and at least 50% of my school’s population were international students, a majority of them from those regions. 2 days before spring break ends, we get an email by the school. It said that if you left the country and visited any regions where Covid cases were located that your were required to quarantine, it was mandatory. Two weeks of quarantine to try and prevent the spread of the virus is totally fair, right? Yes, i agree, that is until the school said that a mandatory quarantine by the school forcing you to stay home and miss class, would not be an excused absence and would count as 2 of your 5 absences. We were livid. The school had every opportunity to tell us beforehand that this was the case as Covid was a well known threat, but no, they wait until 2 days before spring break was over to tell us this important information. I’m pretty sure half of the students wouldn’t have left if they knew this was the case. These were two absences that people may have been saving to catch up on finals, or two absences that they used already to catch up on midterms as they just passed. Just taken. Soon during that week,  the school went remote, so luckily this two week quarantine BS wouldn’t have been an issue because it was all online, but it was just so BS. I graduated in May of 2020. I’m sorry that this ran so long, I didn’t expect it to. I know I only had to deal with this for one year, but I had so many friends who were underclassmen that I couldn’t stand to leave them to deal with this for the next 1-2 years. I’m grateful for what I’ve learned there, but I hated my schools way of how they treated their students, not just this policy, and unfortunately from what I’m aware of, the policy hasn’t changed (I just hope for future students I’m wrong about that).

TL;DR My school implemented a no excused absences policy starting fall of 2019, including medically excused absences. Essentially a legal doctors note by a medical professional would be denied and you’d still have that absence held against you. 5 absences and you fail the course instantly. It stressed everyone out to the point where we had a petition go around to try and budge the administration, which still didn’t work. It got worse when Covid hit and mandatory quarantine for 2 weeks was implemented for students who left the country and came back during spring break, which still, the school refused to excuse! They forced us to stay home and still counted it against us.",3,1,Matt4898

I'm a senior and don't really care about my major, yet I still feel somewhat productive when I'm actually taking time to learn. 



I've had none of that for the last few semesters. I was free all day and was supposed to work on my assignment. But I instead waited until 1 a.m to ""start"" it because I figured I'm awake til 5 a.m anyway (it's 4:30 rn).

Every new semester, we’d always wait until the last day before break ends to have our new timetable and to register for our subjects. Even the timetable they give out is not even fully dependable. They’ll give a timetable for all the students in diploma, degree or masters. It doesn’t follow your classes or anything. Some subjects in the timetable aren’t even offered during the time. (We’d register online and the subjects shown aren’t even in the list) It honestly feels like I’m wasting my time in this college because I feel like I’m not learning anything.

202,ps8aep,2021-09-21 01:14:50,CollegeRant,I think I've emabarrassed myself during a math groupwork?,"I've always struggled in any math courses. I think the highest final mark I've gotten in a college level math was a B.

So, my prof doesn't really teach anything in class. The majority of the lecture meetings are a bunch of groupwork. He does this flip classroom style of teaching, which it doesn't suit my style of learning. Unfortunately, he is the only prof who teaches it, so I'm stuck with that professor. I held it off for two years and now in my junior year I am forced to take it. I am taking discrete math btw.

This morning we were assigned a group to work with as usual. I was lucky to be grouped up with two social butterflies. I barely spoke but still tried to contribute some thing, eventhough it was wrong most of the time. Then it was my turn to write somethings on the board. I was completely clueless. At first, I simply wrote down what they told me until they noticed I got no idea how to solve it. I was half panicking and half embarrassed at the same time. The guy asked me in my group if I understood it in a loud voice. The guys next to us looked at me, but I still tried to play it cool. I was completely mortified at that point. I was speechless since I didn't get what the prof told us in class when he quickly taught us with only two examples. I wasn't quick enough to understand it. Then we were off to work with our group. My group looked at me awkwardly until they moved on and spoke by themselves. I tried to give some inputs here and there before ending the class, tho it was an awkward exchanged between us. 

When I left the class, I tried to push it in the back of my mind for the next few hours. It worked by busying myself with my other courses. Now I'm reminded of it again lol! I'll have to deal with awkward groupwork for the rest of the semester.

Some groups or I guess some guys I had work with stayed away from me since I couldn't answer the question quick enough in the past or didn't understand problem. I basically would spend a few days understanding some problems in order to get it. I spent 3 days working on my assignment until I understood them. Unfortunately, I'm still clueless how to do one question lol! Even after reading a bunch of related topics online. I asked a friend to explain some questions, who studies in another school, which she patiently explained to me until I got it. However, she can't help all the time, so I'm still looking for a tutor to help me out some problems. I'm not thinking of what they think of me, but I somewhat hate myself for not understanding math fast enough to contribute something during any related groupwork. I always feel useless that's all.

Normally would be one of my favs for the semester, since I'm a history major and have never taken a history class that I didn't love, but I guess it's true that all it takes is a bad teacher to ruin a great subject..

Day 1, we were told no textbook, because the university store wasn't able to get them in stock. Okay, cool, we're mostly using lectures and documentaries with some online reading supplements. Affordable and efficient!

Week 3, the store has suddenly got some copies of the book! Not enough for even half of the class, but oh well- teacher now reverses his previous statement and requires us to ALL have the book within the next 2 weeks. We were all a little bitter about it, especially because it's apparent by this point that our ""professor"" has no idea how to teach and no real interest in teaching, this being his first time teaching. Also his main job is in the legal field, so his version of a ""short essay"" (aka, assigned with the due date being 2 days later) is 7 pages, with the length of our ""long essays"" yet to be announced..

Anyway! I went and bought the textbook immediately after class because of the short supply. Tried to rent it first, but lo and behold, it's purchase only. A little over $130. Sucks, but hey, not the MOST expensive textbook I've ever had to buy. 

The worst part was sitting at the library to study the first 4 chapters (which had sort of been covered in class through the previous means, but were now expected to be read and discussed) and realizing immediately that it's a high school level history textbook. Like.. there are ""vocabulary"" words every few pages, that aren't the key terms/figures, but are just definitions of random words in the paragraphs that MIGHT be unknown by high school students, but are definitely daily vocab usage in college, especially when the pre-reqs include U.S. History I and World History I (both were fantastic btw!). 

Idk, it just feels like the teacher didn't do any research, just picked the first textbook google threw at him, and now is suddenly and lazily changing the syllabus without any regard to how confusing and disappointing his class is.

(Side note?/end note?) - all of his previous ""lectures"" were just read straight from the teachers' edition of the book, so he hasn't even put in the minimal effort to engage with the class or provide any original content)

Honestly so furious! Currently studying Higher Childcare and it's my final year. We have to do a lot of groupwork and so far, I've always been the top of the class due to me overstudying. (I'm very passionate about studying and learning this course as it's my dream job) 

We were told last week to do research on a specific topic and then split into groups who also studied the same topic. Now, we're all doing online learning still, so it's face to face.

I was put in a group of people who refer to their lecturers as ""big Sandra"" rather than their actual name which is just disrespectful. They're also the same people who complain about failing stuff when they haven't even handed in anything.

I did my research obviously. My laptop isn't the best so a different girl had to write and share her screens. Throughout the whole group work, I contributed my notes that were relevant to the work and the girl writing the notes? 

She ignored every single one of my notes!

We're studying childcare so every note we had had to be about children or children and their parents! 

They wrote crap about poor people living in poverty and when I tried to guide them by saying ""Oh, well, what if we mentioned a couple things about children too?""

And they ignored me. I thought my mic was muted so I asked them if they could hear me and they said yeah. 

This continued for half an hour before I snapped and asked them why they weren't adding my notes despite me putting it in the chat box over and over again. Then the girl told me to keep my weave on and ugh, I couldn't be bothered.

They all seem like they're in their own 'clique' because they all just graduated high school frankly, I couldn't be bothered with them.

They sent in crappy notes. The lecturer yelled at ME to which I explained my notes consisted of child related ones. She asked me why I didn't contribute and I explained the situation. She told me I should stop being childish.

206,ppebnd,2021-09-16 14:25:19,CollegeRant,All the hard work I did before the pandemic means nothing to my school.,"Even though classes are in person again, I'm starting to think that the after effects of online learning have permanently ruined college for me.

Before the pandemic, I had a GPA of 3.7. Exclusively online learning does not work for me. I genuinely cannot process the information. I wound up withdrawing from most of my classes and I passed all the ones I did take, but my grades were poor enough to drop my GPA down to 3.2. Despite this still being a perfectly fine (if no longer honors) GPA and all of my classes having passing grades, my school put me on academic probation. 

This involved going through an incredibly patronizing short online course that, among other things, suggested that I simply get off my computer and go outside more... things that couldn't possibly have been an issue for the past year due to circumstances outside of my control, right? It also suggested that perhaps what we call ADHD is just the result of kids not going outside enough, which I found horrifically uninformed and offensive as someone with ADHD who spent plenty of time outdoors as a kid. 

I had the option then of either joining another equally patronizing class on a topic like ""avoiding procrastination"" or ""getting motivated,"" or attending academic counseling. I decided to go with the latter, and even though it's not all bad, it's really insufferable being forced to attend what feels like the college equivalent of mandated defensive driving classes where I'm told that I need to spend practically 30 hours a week outside of class studying and if I think that's ineffective for me and the way I learn then I just need to learn better study techniques, and that I need to work harder because ""I'm an upperclassman now and my classes will want me to think critically"" or something like that. (Did I not think critically before now?? What kind of college, or hell, even high school classes don't require critical thought?)

I genuinely do not give a fuck anymore about graduating with honors. I barely give a fuck about college at all anymore. I want to care as much as I used to, but the hard work I put in before the pandemic seems to be completely meaningless.",5,1,subversiveradiohost

But after registration, I got a job where I work the night shift. The one in person class was literally right in the middle of when I’d be sleeping. So on days I have class, I go to sleep two hours early, sleep for four hours, go to class, and then sleep for four more hours. I tried to switch my class to a different time but I go to a really small community college and all the other classes were already full. I REALLY don’t want to have to change my sleep schedule to where I go to sleep in the afternoon and wake up right before I go to work. 

And the part that I really keep getting stuck on is that I don’t actually need these two classes. This past spring I applied for a different university but I’m having a LOT of trouble with my application so I won’t be able to start until this upcoming spring. I didn’t take any classes in the summer either. I like school. I feel stagnant and anxious and restless when I’m not taking classes. I knew to get into the program I wanted I was going to eventually take these two classes anyways so I went to my local community college to take them. BUT I changed my major to a slightly different program and I don’t even need them anymore. 

I already dropped the online class because it was an absolute mess, I have never seen a class structured so terribly, and it was stressful and horrible. I don’t mind my in-person class, I enjoy the class well enough and having homework to do. But I’ve already skipped a class and I’m skipping today because I forgot I had to go to sleep earlier and I’m so exhausted, I don’t want to go to class on an hour of sleep… but I kind of need to go to lecture to do well. 

I could suck it up and change my sleep schedule. But as I was writing this out I realized how stupid it is to take a class I don’t need “just for fun.” It’s not fun anymore. And if I withdraw this week I get my money back and it won’t effect my GPA. More like I need to suck it up and drop it. 

I hate not being in school and just working. I like my job and I have hobbies and friends that keep me busy but idk I feel like I’m not doing enough. I’m not working towards my goals, I’m just kind of passing the time. But I guess I should appreciate and enjoy these forced breaks because once I do go back to school I’ll be crazy busy.

Enter a public  university in 2020, during the first few months of the year before the  COVID pandemic struck. Spend, probably, about 4 months total in  face-to-face classes. The experience was somewhat disappointing. I don't  know what it's like at other universities, but if you quickly google  what the experience is like at English-speaking universities, most of  them tend to agree that it's a bit more liberating, full of  responsibilities, but at the same time flexible and allows you to  explore and choose your dreams/interests. That's not what happened to  me. On the contrary, college feels like high school 2.0, but now on  legendary difficulty. Still, I tried my best and even became class  president during my first semester. Fast forward a bit and now we have  COVID, which forced us into one of the worst educational experiences  I've ever had in my life: online classes.

My  country has a mediocre infrastructure, but its educational system came  to the fore as soon as we were forced to change our teaching method.  Teachers, to this day, have been unable to adapt to this new environment  despite having better resources than the vast majority of students in  public universities. We have daily internet problems, sectors of cities  or towns are without power for hours, and sometimes days at a time.  Teachers don't let you make no excuses for such circumstances and blame  you if you fail to turn in your homework, assignments, exercises, and  even exams. Did your internet fail in the middle of an online test? Too  bad.

Oh, and most homework must be  done by hand. Pen and paper. And then we have to scan them somehow and  send it in. In short we do twice the work for half the reward. Well,  that's the annoying thing, but now the worst thing: the teachers are  incredibly mediocre, and this is something that worries and annoys me  seriously. Some teachers make excuses for not teaching ''Oh, my internet  is down, I won't be teaching, so I'll leave you an assignment. However,  we are not allowed to have internet failures. Somehow that is up to us  )? Incidentally, classes have become more conversations and rants about  how lazy, useless and disappointing we students are. Every day, every  class, has become a fight between teacher vs. student. Synergy is  non-existent and some teachers have told us to our faces that they have  no patience for us.

I'm honestly  thinking about dropping out of college. I don't see a future in this.  Considering that my country is incredibly corrupt, bureaucratic and  mediocre, I am beginning to seriously doubt the quality of higher  education, especially after experiencing it in person. The effort on the  part of the teachers to teach us is nil, but at the same time, I must  also place some blame on the students. I have had students begging me  directly for homework, students who never attend classes and then form  groups to pass live copies to each other during exams, or students who  prefer to take advantage of group work and do nothing. It's a horrible  experience, which I absolutely hate. Filled with depression, for the  first time I have begun to have incredibly dark thoughts about myself. I  simply want to quit all this. I don't think it's worth it, and at the  rate we're going, I think it's going to be 3 whole years of classes this  way. The damage is already done.

TL;DR:  University experience in a central american country sucks extremely.  You'll learn crap, you'll pay with your mental health, you'll have time  to do nothing and your future is uncertain unless you have someone else  to help you or offer you a job since day 1.",2,1,Endless_01

212,pkwnv9,2021-09-09 12:18:07,CollegeRant,I despise having online classes at 7 am and its a crime.,"Im in mexico, we are still online, literally no one in my uni is having classes at 7 am. our semester is the only one, oh and we have been doing this two semesters in a row, why?? because my optics teacher has kids and it suits her better to have classes at 7 am. bc thanks to her kids shes already awake. so we have to suffer too.   
I dont know if yall in the us, are used to classes at 7 am, and you may see this as a joke but its so fucking insane to be in your own home at fucking 7 am, like ive tried anything coffee, having a shower at 6 fucking am, sleeping 8 hours, but nothing helps, i just feel so bad when i wake up and have to sit in my fucking computer. 

I dont have a problem on waking up early to actually go to the campus, that's good because you get to see your pals and shit, but being alone at home, listening to class that no ones wants to take because they're fucking sleeping, oh and that's another thing, everyone is asleep, expect a few of us, so it feels so unfair. I just want it to be over but the semester still have 3 fucking months left.

Any tips on how to change my mind?? like i know everything is on my head, i drink coffe and somedays takes showers before getting online, i just wish i could have my brain washed to wake up earlier.",5,1,roseekilljoy

I have a professor who is going overboard as well as a professor who is structuring things beautifully. I am inspired to compile a list of things I think should be standard for online courses, feel free to add or rant.

1. **Keep the due date time 11:59.** I'm tired of seeing these 12pms, 5pms, 8pm, etc.   

2. **Upload the resources you intend on being of use.** No more saturated BlackBoard/icollege/etc pages with information that is never used. Only keep the important things that are pertinent to foundation knowledge and exams, pls.  

3. **You cannot be hybrid asychronous/synchronous, pick one.** We adjust our schedules based on your structure, can't having you switching up and then me being accountable for lost information you spontaneously shared and never uploaded for me to know about. Sick of it.  

4. **Please turn the mic up on your videos.** My speakers only go up to 100%, not 200%, not 300%...  

5. **Please start yo class on time and finish on time.** I will not be held captive just because it is online.  

6. **Sessions should be 85% covering material and 15% answering questions.** If I had a dollar for every time an instructor stopped to answer every question, I would not be here right now. I'm tired of only getting through 2 slides of a 90 slide ppt. PLS.  

7. **Do not give break out sessions if the objective was not furfilled.** Its literally just 6 students in a chatroom and silence for like 20 minutes.",34,1,Ether_of_Joti

I’m a junior and before the pandemic I never had to do introductions. Even my in-person 300 level stats course wants us to upload  a picture of ourselves and describes ourselves. It’s kind of strange to me especially since there’s 200 people in this class and it’s not my major. Maybe the professors actually care and want to get to known us but it’s strange to me since the last time I was in person my professors did not care at all.

At first it was fine but then it got so boring. I started accidentally sleeping through some classes and because it was online and I didn’t know anyone I didn’t know who to ask for help and I was also very afraid of speaking to people or presenting and stuff. Anyway I passed only one class the whole year and I just keep telling myself this year will be different and I’ll be able to do it but I don’t know how or what to do and if my parents find out it will be the death of me,38,1,bibitibobitiboup

I’m super frustrated because on Tuesday when we go back to class. I’m expected to sit side-by-side with like 40 other people. I don’t even leave my apartment unless I’m going to class.

I think I’m going to drop this “plant science” class get a big fat “withdrawal” (F) grade and only take one class. I’ll be a real loser then. Didn’t want to take this class, registered late because I’m a lazy, depressed POS. I don’t get the lab homework, I don’t even know how to begin on starting them, I don’t know how write the “discussion” and “results” pages when I’ve never done anything like this before. I don’t how I’m supposed to find plants to write about when it’s almost impossible for me to go to a plant store and look/buy them (I don’t drive of course). I don’t know how I’m supposed to look around the landscape at types of grass/special landscaping. Lmao I don’t know, so I figure dropping the class while I have an hour left to do so is better than failing and making a fool of myself. 
My mom thinks I’m a fucking lazy loser because I can’t just do the fucking class. I wish I could. I wish shit was easier for me and I wasn’t such a fucking idiot who is slow at things and never taken a real fucking science class. I don’t work, don’t do chores, don’t do anything or have any friends so just doing two little online classes should be the easiest thing in the world, right? But I’m too much of a fucking loser for even that, so I’m going to still be a dropout taking one class after doing nothing for a whole fucking year. I’m really extremely depressed and feeling totally fucking worthless, nobody fucking cares what I do and that’s the truth. Yeah , if i wasn’t some fucking loser who is depressed by thought of just “living” (trying to do things to other people’s standards) then yeah, taking these two classes might be easy enough. But it isn’t. And I’m a fucking useless, stupid loser who isn’t good enough for easy online classes much less a fucking job or whatever else. 

TLDR: I’m a fucking idiot. Too useless and stupid for this “easy” online science class, so I’m dropping it and officially accepting my status as a failed loser/dropout who will never have a job. Probably work at Walmart and fucking rot the rest of my life—how ridiculous to think I wanted to go into psychology or teaching, law, etc., lmao.

For context, I am an engineering major. I took Statics fall of 2020, signed up for a professor with okay ratings on RateMyProfessor. No big deal. Surprise! 2 weeks before classes start, I get a new professor. He had just come out of retirement and seemed nice enough. Wrong, worst professor I’ve ever had. He stumbled over his words, has really bad handwriting, can only teach out of the textbook, and always messed up his calculations. First class I ever failed (I got a different professor in the spring and ended with an A). 

I then take Solids summer of 2021, signed up for a really good professor that everyone likes. Again! 1 month before my class starts, his name shows up on my schedule. Didn’t go to class once, self-studied and got a B (online so it wasn’t terrible). 

And now, fall of 2021. I have to take Fluid Mechanics and I sign up for a professor who has been teaching the class for a few years, not bad.

I definitely cannot do housing as it’s much cheaper to stay at my home as that’s also close to where I plan to work next week. Oh my god work. I’ll probably have less time to finish the hw and etc for other classes, and especially later during the year when I’m given paper due dates and projects and etc to work on.

222,pdj6va,2021-08-28 22:20:10,CollegeRant,IAmA virtual assistant who helps adults with college classes. AMA!,"For me, the college experience has lasted almost 15 years because I started doing it as my profession.  

I make it easy for busy adults to get through their college classes - Nursing, Business Administration, Education, Criminal Justice. There is NO academic dishonesty; I just help, same as any other remote assistant. But I know a lot of people think it’s terrible, so... let’s have the conversation.

Reddit is the best place to discuss this strange new digital age industry (i.e. virtual assistant work for college papers &amp; online classes).

I'll tell you a bunch of stuff about my work:

* I'm like other virtual assistants, but college research = my specialization and I have a lot of experience with online classes.
* Some of my clients are bilingual and multilingual English learners (ESL). Others are busy professional people who are working overtime to pay tuition, and they are spread too thin. They would like to do their own classes, but right now life is a hectic struggle. I also have clients who need help simply because they’ve found themselves in one of those classes that are truly meaningless and no one cares.
* Hiring a virtual assistant to help with papers or a whole college class... you still learn everything, but without spending all those hours. I mean, you learn every concept from every unit of study. Idk if you learn it as well as you are supposed to, but you obviously follow along and find out all the shit that is being taught.

To those of you who think everyone should do all their own work without an assistant: You’re probably right. In a sense, you’re right. My work undermines something about higher education, and “quality of education” is not just some abstract thing. It’s the only thing. The future for our society (in other words, our kids and their kids) depends on it. Good education is what will cure cancer and end wars. Education will lead to new innovations for reversing climate change. It really is \*the\* issue. It is not something that should be undermined.

And part of education is the struggle that leads to inner strength. I take away the struggle.  My clients struggle enough already at their jobs and other responsibilities ([Americans have been getting less and less sleep in recent decades!](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/sleepless-in-america/201001/are-we-really-getting-less-sleep-we-did-in-1975)), and they don't want to struggle with online classes. I don't blame them. And I'm grateful to the people who hire me, so I can make a living this way.

I guess my argument would be:  Higher education is *already* undermined by profiteering in the industry, which is why [tuition is 25% since 2008](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/13/cost-of-college-increased-by-more-than-25percent-in-the-last-10-years.html) (that increase seems so insane to me). And it happens in the context of an economy that is like a pressure-cooker, and the working-class people are the meat. They take their classes online, because they want to stay productive and keep trying to make ends meet.

I honestly think it’s possible for a degree candidate to use a virtual assistant in a way that enables them to get the most out of each class.

Do you think it’s inherently unethical? Or do you think this particular type of virtual assistant work can be done in a way that is a net positive for everyone involved?

AMA, thanks for reading all this!

224,pckkib,2021-08-27 10:20:30,CollegeRant,My College Bookstore.,"In the year 2020, when all hell broke loose, my local community college decided to make a permanent switch to a digital bookstore. In other words, the students no longer need to go to the campus bookstore to purchase their texts and other materials. Quite frankly, that is fine by me as the lady who was in charge of the campus bookstore was quite the impatient asshole.

I'm in my last semester of community college before I transfer to an university and so far, ordering my texts and materials through the digital bookstore has been an easy process for the previous two semesters.

Until now.

Please tell me why my college decided to wait until *the day after the last day* of purchases on financial aid to approve a $30 virtual lab for one of my science courses? A virtual lab that I will have to pay out of pocket (mind you, I don't have an issue with paying out of pocket for something very inexpensive but I would be lying if I said my personal funds weren't running tight right about now).

To make matters worse, during the authorization period of purchases made on financial aid, the college had told my instructor that another lab set (cost: $166), a physical lab, was the approved lab and orders could be made. I made that order on the 18th, the lab is on its way, and I have to wait until I receive that order before I can return it which might have to include shipping costs that I will have to pay out of pocket for. 

It's irritating because the college didn't have their information correct, told my instructor one thing only to be told another thing at the last minute, and now some of us students have to contend with making costly returns that could have been avoided if the college had their bookstore crap together.

Oh yeah, did I tell you there is a campus specific return time frame? *Sigh...*

I honestly don't know what the world happened this semester. The college operated so much more smoothly and better during actual lockdown when everything went online and virtual for us students. Now that they are back to campus operations, they can't seem to figure out that 2+2 and 2\*2 both equal 4. 

Also, it just isn't this particular class that has been having issues with text and materials. I've spoken with other students whose textbooks were chronically out of stock or hadn't been correctly updated for any current edition that was required for their class.

As I stated earlier, this is my last semester here and while I have been content with my experience so far, I'm grateful I'm moving forward to an university that handles their operations a little bit better.

How the absolute flying fuck can they charge $300 and not bind the damn book into an actual fucking book? I thought we were supposed to keep these and put these on the shelf later on in our careers. My professor literally told me on the first day of my chemistry class to keep this book because it'll come in handy at times. It's 900 pages of essentially hold punched barely even high gloss paper. This isn't a ""book"" I'd want to keep or be proud to have on the shelf in my office. Maybe I'm just being too sensitive because I'm very frustrated over the cost of school and how much shit I have to print off myself from online resources for classes but holy shit I thought at least I'd get more for my money with the books at least.",15,1,Parklane390

236,p4obsr,2021-08-15 06:22:20,CollegeRant,Most of your friends you make in the first year will probably drop out.,"Now this post is purely based on my experience.

I studied at a small university. We had classes of 20-30 people. After the first year this was narrowed down to 12 people.  18 people quit after the first year.

There is alot to say about college and its differculty. The reason why there are so few people with degrees is becuase the system is designed to get rid of the people not prepared to do the work.

If you survive the first year you have obviously done te work. If you haven't it will come back to bite you. The work load and the level gets progressively harder as the degree continues. There is no cakewalk at college. You either do the work or your fucked. Either now or later.

Degrees in my counry are only 3 years as most of the time the foundational year can be skipped for young students.

I hate to say it but there will be weeks where everything feels hopeless. There will be weeks where you have pulled all nighters for 5 days to get work done. If you miss a class thats on you.   There are scheduling tools out their to ensure you don't. Use them and you will be successful.

I am aware many of you are dealing with online classes right now. I know its differcult but one thing you need to know about online classes is that you should not take shortcuts.

Do you believe taking shortcuts will help you with your bachelor thesis. Unfortunately it won't. Many a times universities tell students to pick a topic or choose a topic for themselves they would like to research. Then they offer you a project, with an obscure subject matter. This prevents cheating as the research might not even exist to cheat off.

237,p3j5m1,2021-08-13 08:11:42,CollegeRant,I wish I chose a different college to attend,"I'm going to a local community college close to where I live so for the sake of privacy I won't name any of the colleges.

The CC I go to is absolute shit. We're doing everything online, which sucks, but I can understand why due to the current conditions. What I am mad about however is the fact that they basically made themselves less available to people who were unfortunate enough to not know what the fuck was going on.

For context, their in-person offices were closed, so when I say everything is online I really mean everything is online and the campus is basically still down.

I had some issues with trying to apply to a language arts class and a writing class. Turns out I kept trying to apply to the wrong ones, but at the same time, no one told me how to navigate it. It was never in the orientation or the instructional video - they just told you to apply to classes with ""Q"" which, as an incoming freshman makes no sense. 

The college website was confusing as hell to navigate and I ended up emailing the English counselor instead of the general outreach counselors because I was so confused and didn't know they even existed until I straight up asked my cousin who went to my CC a few years ago what is happening, which my cousin responded they didn't know because my CC apparently changed the GenEd requirements this year. Apparently the general outreach counselors were talked about in a different website separate to the list of counselors page. 

Emailing them only led them to say that they cannot help me via email. Because of the influx of students contacting for help, they couldn't do appointments and we had to just drop-ins during a 3 hour time span of 4 days and hope today's not a busy day, which took about a week of waiting before I was finally able to get a spot. By the time that happened, all but one class was full and apparently that professor is reported to make students feel like absolute shit and stupid for their writing. (I did contact another professor to be put on a waitlist for his class, and hoping the amount of work he expects from students puts some off to drop out). 

I feel like if they just had planned appointments instead of drop ins, or their stupid website actually organized their pages, or if they didn't even rely on their website and had a more convenient way to access support, or I don't know, actually teach us how to schedule classes before giving us a bunch of letters and numbers none of us have seen before in our lives. You'll think after a year of online learning they'll know what to do by now but either I'm just really dumb and bitching about things I could have prevented if I just thought through it, or my CC just didn't care to change anything to make things easier for us

There was another CC I wanted to go, but couldn't because I felt too unprepared to move 5 hours away from my home. (Still don't know how bills work hahahha.... I'm fucked-) It had good reviews, a program that relates to the major I want to get into (plus the major I want and a variety of majors I can see myself taking. My college doesn't even have environmental studies which is what I was originally going for, closest thing I can get to that is biology), free admission to several in-state hard-to-get-into universities as long as you meet enough requirements, and apparently keeps sending emails about events and surveys about what students would like to see be implemented or changed. If it wasn't for fucking location I would have been able to go there and not have to go through the BS of a CC that doesn't even have environmental studies.",5,1,Monthly_Vent
238,p332k2,2021-08-12 16:13:54,CollegeRant,Professor called me by the wrong name in front of class,"So a few semesters ago during class my professor had asked a question and when I raised my hand he called me by a different name looked at me and he as well as the class was waiting for a response. Now I usually don’t respond to any other name than mine so I guess as a “reaction” I didn’t answer at first however since he was still waiting for a response I then answered anyway (even though I wasn’t sure if he even meant me because again he said a completely different name). I felt embarrassed when this happened but went up to the professor after class to clarify that that’s not my name. He did apologize and explained that on the sheet he had us fill out at the begging of the semester (we are about 30 students so not a huge lecture hall more like a normal classroom) with all our names on them corresponding to where we were sitting in class he must have confused one row of seats with the other. (This seating arrangement also meant that we could never change seats throughout the semester).

Anyway scrolling through reddit I just remembered so I thought I’d share because as much as this was an honest mistake afterward I just kinda felt dispensable as a student and wondered why I even give a single sh\*t about class when my professors barely care about who their students are (I attend a smaller community college where you pretty much know and see everyone even without being a social butterfly).

However, this year, I’m doing dual enrollment classes at my local community college in addition to my own classes at school. The classes are online and asynchronous (I have a chronic illness and generally like to limit my exposure to COVID, especially with my high school being in-person and cases on the rise where I live). The classes I chose are in subjects that I generally like (Writing Fiction and Archaeology), and the teachers are rated pretty good on Rate My Professor (English professor is 3/5 and Archaeology professor is 4.5/5). Despite this, though, I’m still worried that I’m biting off more than I can chew.. 

I’ve taken 5 AP classes, 1 IB class, and honors classes all throughout high school, and gotten good scores on most of the exams I’ve taken. I’m taking AP Calculus BC this year in addition to my required courses for graduation. There are no more English classes for me to take at my school, so I have to do it here. I only know one other person doing dual enrollment (my friend), but he’s taking way different classes than me, and all of his are in-person.  

I was wondering if anyone had any advice for these college classes and coping with everything, or any sort of encouragement? If anyone else is or used to be a dual enrollment student, I’d really like to hear what you think.

242,p1eyw4,2021-08-10 01:14:03,CollegeRant,"I feel like I'll never have the ""true college experience""","This will be long, so I apologize in advance.  I am 19 and entering my sophomore year of college.  I currently live with my parents and commute to school (about a 25-minute drive).  For a bit more context on my university: the university I attend is in the middle of a city and has a lot of commuters, so a lot of people pretty much just go to class and leave.  They have on-campus events, clubs, and things of the like, but the student body is not as tight-knit as other 4-year colleges.  For a bit about myself: I am an education major and have a pretty high GPA right now.  I love my major and am passionate about teaching and the subject I plan to teach, so I'm not worried about anything academic-related.

Pretty much everyone can agree that this past school year sucked due to COVID, whether you lived on or off-campus.  This past year was not great for me, to say the least.  Everyone hypes up freshman year of college, but because of COVID, it was a bust.  Sure, I joined the college chorus, which helped a little, but I haven't really made any close connections with the people there.  Most of my classes were online, so I was also only on campus 3 days a week for 2-3 hours in the fall.  It was better in the spring, and I was on campus 3 days a week for about 6ish hours.  I dislike online classes and need to be around people, even though I don't talk to them.  The presence of others just helps, if that makes any sense.

My uni was really strict about masks.  You had to wear them all the time, even outdoors.  They were originally going to not require masks this year, but they recently sent an email that said everyone has to do so inside regardless of vaccination status but vaccinated people can take them off outside.  I got vaccinated near the end of the year and officially became immune the day after finals ended.  I've always been really good about wearing masks and all that.  I don't like wearing them all the time, but it's necessary and you just gotta do it.  I wear them at my summer job, even when I was the only worker wearing one and I was getting harassed by customers for it.  I'm just so sick of the politicization about COVID and all the anti-maskers, but that's a rant for another time lol.

Basically, I just feel like this pandemic is gonna last my entire college career.  I'll never be able to go maskless inside or just talk to people without the fear of spreading this virus.  It feels like college will be overshadowed by the pandemic and I'll never have a ""normal"" college experience.  For many different reasons, my high school experience was very traumatic and I just wanted to start anew in college, but it's really hard to do that with COVID.  The only person from high school I regularly keep in touch with is my best friend, who is a year younger than me and is going to college out-of-state.  My parents are generally understanding, but sometimes they can just be overprotective of me.  To add to all this, I have a lot of mental health problems (anxiety, depression, possibly OCD?, but I'm not formally diagnosed with anything) and it just makes everything harder.  I don't want to hear any of the ""you just gotta get out there and make friends quit throwing yourself a pity party"" BS because frankly, I know that it's all my fault that I'm in this position.  I'm not asking for a whole lot out of my college experience.  I just want to find some friends to make good memories with, but it just doesn't seem feasible.

243,p0t8sl,2021-08-09 03:19:58,CollegeRant,I had a very traumatic semester (fall of 2019) and ever since college makes me anxious and depressed..,"Fall of 2019 I had a very traumatic semester where I entered my foundations of nursing class and my guidance counselor told me it was mandatory to take 5 nursing classes together (it was in fact not the case and my guidance counselor misled me) fall of 2019 I took - pharmacology, pathophysiology, child development, foundations + clinicals (12 hour clinical every week), and history of nursing. 

between the 40 minute commuting to and from school, between pass/fail skills labratories practicing skills, insane sudden due dates, work, 5 classes every week, 12 hour clinical day (so technically 6 classes), pass/fail exams, etc. It was very hard to juggle all of this work.

 I ended up getting fired from my job right before the pandemic (january of 2020) because I couldnt work more than a day and I didnt meet the jobs requirements of working more than one day considering I was taking all these classes and they basically got fed up and fired me. and during the fall I basically had so much course work I was studying so hard and ended up failing a class (pharmacology), but passed all the other classes. My fundamentals class I almost failed and when I approached the professor to question how much of a shot I have left in the class she looked me in the eyes and with the coldest expression said, ""Honestly, just drop my class"" and left it at that. I didnt drop her class and ended up passing it. My financial aid somehow got screwed up that semester so I couldnt register for my courses (but being that I failed a class it didnt matter). When you fail a class you have to go to the actual dean to re-register for the class and that was extremely embarrassing. So that semester really stuck with me. I get anxiety over taking bad professors, I work as hard as I could (I'm not a student who slacks off). But now its like I HAVE to overcompensate because I dont ever want to be in a situation like that ever again, like ever again. I would call up my boyfriend every single night crying on the phone feeling like I lost my chance to make something out of myself. My boyfriend is also in nursing (different program) 

I really think the fall of 2019 screwed me up mentally because I went through organic chemistry, anatomies, microbiologies, etc. before this and I never had college anxiety like this before. Now it seems like I dread the upcoming semester and I try to over compensate to never be in that boat I was in in the fall of 2019. I made it past my medical-surgical rotations, made it past a pharm 1 and 2 and all the other classes. 

I love the major I've taken up and really love clinicals. But man, the exams and schooling really get to me. I just cant wait to be done. I'm now going into my pediatrics and obstetrics rotation and I'm very-very nervous and I have a pass/fail math exam this semester. But I keep telling myself I'm almost through. I got a year and a half left. 

The pandemic was honestly a god send for me, the commuting gets to me and not having to commute really put me in a good place. The online platform allowed me to studying to the very last minute until the exams were up. The privacy of not having to worry about interacting with others allowed me to focus on what I need to do. I'm going back in person next semester and I'm anxious over this.",2,1,Lelricaa

I go on to take the midterm and you have to use the lockdown browser with webcam even though the exam is open book open note. I log in, and immediately couldn’t get the textbook to work with the browser. I brushed it off, I didn’t really think I would need it anyway.

Towards the end, it froze again and I had to email my TA again. I had to end up switching computers and finishing the exam with the 10 minutes I had left. This was a two hour exam and I had lost an hour of time. I rushed through it and was able to finish it in time and submitted it. Couple days later, I get my results back and I’ve failed the exam. I immediately emailed my TA, not sounding desperate, but telling him how I was shocked at how low my score was after studying and thought that my exam not working half the time most likely had an impact on my score. He responded back saying there was basically nothing I could do (even though the highest score was a 92 with a D class average, there is no curve). I have to get an A on the final to be able to pass.

I absolutely hate chemistry, however, I decided to take it as a summer course rather than traditionally in the fall/spring just to lessen my load in the school year. (I'm behind on the 4-year track but I don't care that much anymore) I wanted to go to medical school but after failing Chem 1, I realized that probably wasn't going to happen anymore and switched career paths, I'm still a STEM major though. I decided to take Chem 2 at a community college rather than my university because I generally thought things would be easier. All the lectures and labs were online and I didn't have to drive to class. My life basically was consumed with chemistry for the past 7 weeks and I'm also taking two 4 week courses. (one June, one July)

I've been passing my exams with high B's or A's, currently sitting at 89.5 in the lecture. I just took another lecture exam, which I feel good about too. However my lab on the other hand I'm failing. I cannot pass the class no matter what my lecture grade is without passing the lab (which I must acquire a certain amount of points and get at least a 50% on both formal labs). I've emailed this lab professor multiple times about raising my grade and he has let me turn in my missing labs (I'm struggling a lot in my personal life/mental health right now) but never really gave me a clear answer if I was going to pass the lab or not. I can't even bring it up to the department head, because he IS the department head. He's extremely harsh on grading too, not even encouraging either when I let him know of my situation.

My last lecture exam is this week, and if I do not pass the lab (and no chance of redoing any labs)... I guess there's no point of even taking the exam right?

253,ooxi5d,2021-07-21 19:48:28,CollegeRant,"Not so much of a rant, but I guess a question🤔 Is this normal/has anyone experienced this?"," Not so much of a rant, but I guess a question.

My first year was awful, mostly my fault because of my lack of attention and poor mental health. People there were nice, but there were some weird things going on. Though idk if it’s normal or not cause I come from a small high school and people didn’t really act that way. Also maybe the pandemic had something to do with it. I just need to know if this is normal or not, or if anyone else experienced this at their college. Here’s what happened:

* All the students were depressed, struggling, and failing all their classes. I talked to accommodations there and yes all the freshmen were failing or at least a good majority.
* Some profs had this weird relationship with the school like it is life and nothing else matters but that. One of my profs at the beginning of the year said we had to give up health, family, friends, social life, and everything so we could solely focus on grades and school work…. And it made the whole class a bit uncomfortable.
* The school got called out for accepting $8M+ to help aid in covid crisis, but no one knows where the money is being spent and all the students are still struggling financially. Whatever they did with it wasn’t a bad thing &amp; illegal, I hope, but they act as though they're supporting and caring for everyone but like they mainly spend most of the time asking for money. Idk just weird. They act the same way with diversity/inclusion.
* The school tried to guilt-trip students into not taking a break from school during the pandemic, even though a lot of students were financially and mentally struggling from this crisis. Like a lot of people loss their jobs and are unable to pay the school, which again already has $8M+ for whatever reason.
* If anyone says anything that makes the college/staff look bad (truthful or not) then their financial aid from the school could be taken away which almost everyone is on. I thought it was weird cause when I visited they were big on telling the truth even if it wasn’t a positive thing.
* A prof was reported and had evidence (screenshots, recordings, and eye witnesses) of him being inappropriate physically and verbally with his female students and showing signs of grooming. The school just said “do you need a counselor?” to one of the many ladies (cause the rest didn’t really come out about it) and sent an email saying everything was taken care of but the people involved said it wasn’t and that he still works there till this day. I guess they just gave him a 2nd slap on the wrist, because the 1st slap he got worse in his behavior towards the girl who reported him. Idk but I feel like they should have gone to the police, lawyer, or some kind of professional legal help since they have proof and the school isn’t helping and people online can’t help them either. But since the school made that rule that you can’t say bad things about them and their staff they probably would be in a lot of debt if most/huge chuck of their financial aid is coming from the school.
* Interestingly, our school is near a possible cult according to reviews. It was near the building I was supposed to stay at during my second year. I don’t think most people at the school know since most people there aren’t religious, though many are into spiritualism. I only found it because I was looking for a nearby church to attend and the reviews on it were terrible: separating people from loved ones/others not a part of the church through fear, all other churches are enemies, emotional manipulation, and saying stuff like “study to show thyself approval.” This led me down a giant rabbit hole that I’m gonna need to look at later. From my current knowledge, they aren’t doing anything illegal just being super sus.

I’m in a lot of debt as you can tell, but thankfully I’ll be able to pay it off during my break from college so I wouldn’t have possible debt from transferred college (which is a lot cheaper &amp; something that I could pay off in a reasonable amount of time or even pay in full) and debt from old college (literally too much for 1 year and too much to just let it sit there and grow). I am applying to mainly local, affordable, smaller, Christian colleges. It might not be perfect but it will be better in the long run. Plus, everyone should be able to be fully on campus when I go and I'm gonna make sure to apply early so I can get a better chance of getting a dorm without roommates.

Overall, I feel like a lot of the problems that happened there were because there wasn’t good communication. It was a big school so you’re seen as a number and they usually don’t seem to really react to things unless it hurts their image from the majority of people on the outside or is hurting them financially. The school does have a lot of great resources, but I think with covid and everything it kind of ruined the experience for a lot of people and the school just wasn’t prepared, but like most people weren't either so... I hope that things get better for the school, staff, and students there. It was a wild ride, though I'm thankful for the people I met and the things I did learn there, but I decided it would be better for me to move on.

So again, my question is… is any of this normal at most other colleges that you guys went to, or has anyone experienced anything similar? Thank you :)",2,1,donuthoop

So the class I'm in is like the basics of Chemistry I think. When I google things, highschool gets mentioned a lot lol. Anyway onto my rant.

It started off bad. I get bookservice funds but they expire 2 weeks before class starts typically. So I bought my book and activation codes from the bookstore bit don't bother to set anything up until a few days before class is due to start. But need an invite link to the course which yeah, super common, think nothing of it, no worries. Yeah was I wrong. Whatever textbook we were told to buy is not the right one. The teacher never stated this, just kept telling us crap that didn't work and it took another student to help me figure out what I needed. Idk if that's the teachers fault, but he also failed at getting all the online homework sites set up.

It took until Friday for me to get the textbook, for him to fix the online homework so we could login and we are in an accelerated course. 18wks condensed into 5. Our homework is due every Sunday along with chapter quizzes. At this point I have 2 days to learn 3 chapters plus 50 question homework assignments for each chapter. Needless to say I FLUNKED them.

Anyway, moving on. Every week it's the same. 3 chapters, 3 sets of 50 question homework things, 2-3 lab experiments, some printed out assignments to fill in, discussion boards then chapter quizzes and a larger test of the chapters bundled together. I get it. It's accelerated, it's a ton of work.

But then I notice a pattern. All the homework that isn't part of the textbook, is stuff we learned the week before and I don't get it? Aren't we supposed to be practicing what we're gonna get quizzed on? Why are we practicing what we've moved on from?

The class is online and asynchronous so there's no lectures. Just slides. That have almost zero of the material he quizzes on. So they're a waste of time. And the quizzes. The quizzes. They're almost solely equation problems. Every question. He gives you one minute per question and I'm just...I'm flunking every quiz because I just do not have enough TIME.

I'm not blaming the teacher for my lack of understanding of the material. Something is not clicking for me so I take responsibility for that. But I just feel like I've been set up to fail in this class and I'm so stressed because I can't apply for my program without passing it.",6,1,befuddledmama

259,olu167,2021-07-17 00:47:55,CollegeRant,"Professor effectively failed me for clicking the wrong quiz, and I might have to put college on hold","So, my all-online ethics professor has a kind of messed up policy. Once you start a quiz, (of which there are four, and these are the only graded assignments in the entire class) you have 105 minutes to finish. WIFI goes out, power goes out, server goes offline, anything, and the best possible grade you can get is a 75%.

Well, I clicked on the wrong quiz. I meant to open quiz 2, and opened quiz 3. I had never even heard of the topic it was on, so I closed it immediately and emailed my professor with \~48 hours to the deadline. He didn't even get back to me. I emailed him again with \~24 hours left, and it took him 20 to respond. He gave me an unhelpful response pretty much saying, ""well, it's not my fault.""

I plead my case and 48 hours later, he hasn't gotten back. I was barely maintaining a B average (with an 80.95% in this class), and this dropped my grade to a 53. The term ends July 30.

This class no longer counts for my degree, I'm now ineligible for most of my scholarships, and I get out-of-state tuition next semester on top of that. My cost is now 5 or 6 times what it was last semester, and if I can't get back above a B average by the end of fall, (which I could barely hold) I might have to put my education on pause.

I'm not sure why I'm posting this here. I'm not expecting anybody to be able to help. I don't think this is a matter for any kind of board, so I've pretty much used up my only option in emailing the professor. I guess I just need to vent somewhere.",20,1,QLZX

This exam I just took was fucked. I've done all the homeworks, labs and taken diligent notes from the text. Out of 2 written and 11 multiple choice, I ended up having to just put random answers in 5 that I didn't have time to do. 

I'm fucking irritated. It's 1800 dollars I spent for this course. It's all online and the basis is that I am teaching myself statistics. I don't know dick about statistics, that's why I'm taking the course. 

I'm pissed that the 'professor' answers emails once a day. On average I'm waiting over 4 hours for a response to any email. There's so many fucking discrepancies. In all of the text, there is NO mention or use of calculators but in the homework help she relies heavily on the calculator without direction. 

I asked her about the calculator because I couldn't find the functions and she told me to look it up on youtube. I still couldn't find it and she's been 0 help whatsoever. 

I paid 1800 dollars for 1 email a day and paid separate for the text that I'm teaching myself through. I'm getting fucking shafted! Absolutely fucking shafted. She's got NO office hours. 

I've tried so hard to learn this material and take good notes. 8 hours a day to not know shit on the exam. That's not my fucking fault. That's the professors fucking fault.

I don’t really know where to start with this. I feel so unmotivated and don’t want to do anything, I’m not trying to be lazy, I guess it’s just depression. I’m in a 3 week English class that ends on Friday and I’ve just been nothing but stressed the whole time. I have a final paper due on Friday and only have 4 pages (out of 6). Yeah that’s not a lot, but I just feel so burned out and I know when I finish it tomorrow I’m just going to try to fit random things in and it won’t be the great, well thought out paper it was supposed to be. I just hope I get an ok grade because that’s all I have energy left for. 

I’m also really depressed about my situation and think going to college full time next month will make it worse. I can’t really take in person classes, I live with my parents 15 mins away now and I don’t want to bother them, I’m 21 and want to be independent but I don’t drive anymore. I can’t really get an apartment because my scholarship was canceled because I took all of last year off, so now I only have loans and don’t want to waste them on rent (and I already have bad experiences with roommates, I don’t really want to try again).

I absolutely hate and loathe online classes. But I guess that’s what I’ll have to do again next semester, all while I feel depressed about living with my parents and not being able to get “out into the world” at all. I don’t really have any friends, and when I felt better about talking to people everything shut down and now I don’t think there’s any real way to meet people. 

I also go to a college and am stuck in a little small town I absolutely hate, but I guess there’s no real solution for that other than trying to get over it. I hate that I’m stuck at this school/town because of in-state tuition (it’s all I can afford). I hate the weather, the closed-mind local people, how impossible it is to drive/park anywhere, just everything. 

I guess I would just really like some advice on how to “suck it up” and just get over it. I can’t really move out, and even though my parents don’t bother me, I just really hate how unindependent I have to feel.

TLDR: Im stuck with my parents and can’t move out, have to take full time online classes again next semester (even though it made me so depressed last year I dropped out), no way to meet anyone and feel “alive” and like I’m actually doing things in the world, I hate this town/state and the shitty weather, I can’t do good in my summer class so I guess I’m just going to hope for a passing grade.

I applied in March for the summer term and my application status since then has been pending. The phone numbers they provide for financial aid and admissions just gives an email and then hangs up, so I’ve been emailing like my life depends on it and only getting automatic responses saying they’re getting a lot of emails! 😡
FINALLY today was able to contact admissions and ask them if I’m missing some kind of document or something and that’s why I haven’t been accepted (or rejected!) yet. And yes, they’re waiting for an OFFICIAL AP transcript. I took ONE AP course which they have an “initial” transcript (which I paid for at the very beginning of this year) but of course that’s not good enough. So now I have to figure out how to send an “official” transcript whatever tf that even means… and because of all this bullshit, I won’t be able to start until the spring semester. It’s just so infuriating that there was no indication of this issue on my account and that it has been such a struggle just to contact them. 
But whatever, it sets me one semester behind, no big deal. I submit the application for my new application (so many fucking applications…) and look at the program I want to get into to remind myself what the last gen ed course this university requires for it. Figure I can take it online at a cheap community college (although idk that I want to take even one class and risk confusing the system and setting me even farther behind).
NOPE
Can only join the program in summer or fall terms. So now I’m actually upset, that’s two semesters where I’ll be back home (grandparents have been home base since last year of high school - this is relevant) and doing basically nothing when I’d really like to move back to campus and I like school and I’m ready for a new big university in a big city! 
Fine. I’ll bite my tongue and do what I have to do. 
But wait! There’s more 🙃
Along with the new application application, I had to send another proof of residency form. I guess I fucked up on my original application (I just KNOW there’s going to be a problem since this renewed application is going to be different) because I have no idea if I selected dependent or independent or what documents I provided (I’m an idiot I know) because as I’m filling it out again I realize I actually have no idea. Here’s the thing:
I was born in Florida.
I grew up in Florida. 
I have always lived in Florida. 
I work in Florida, my permanent address is in Florida, I am registered to vote in Florida.
But my mom moves around a lot and she had a place in FL that I've been using for parental proof of residency but she's renting it out and none of the utilities or anything are in her name so now I don’t qualify for in-state tuition. She provides ZERO financial support, I file my own taxes, I have an entirely separate life here in FL. I don’t want to wait three years until I’m 24 to go to school here, I don’t want to pay five times as much tuition as an “out of state” student, and I SURE as shit ain’t moving to Arizona (and then wherever the hell she decides to go next). 
I’m going to call financial aid and see if I can qualify as independent because my mom doesn’t support me at all, but it’s probably going to take another three months just to get in contact with them. (I was considering going to a different school anyways because of the lack of communication, but I'd still like to stay in Florida.) I'm seriously considering getting eloped to my boyfriend to make things easier.

- Day one syllabus quiz. This is the only professor I’ve ever had that did that. There was no point. I was legitimately already an adult. 

- Took 5% of our final grade every time we were absent. I had to cancel a job interview because the only time I was able to schedule it was during her class. When I emailed her, she said that since I didn’t have a doctor’s note, I would lose half a letter grade. She was 20 minutes late to class that day. And every day. When we went online due to the pandemic, she sent an email telling us that since times were difficult, we needed to all be patient and understanding with one another. I was fuming. 

- Gave us writing assignments graded by a computer. This was exactly as absurd as it sounds. We would write one page papers and submit them online. Some algorithm would read it and spit it back out in seconds. We had three tries to fix any problems it had with our work. These were not simple grammar issues; these were actual reading comprehension things this algorithm was looking for. I was a writing tutor at the time. I wrote a fucking book.

I also live on a farm which I am expected to take care of on top of this. So my first semester was a little bumpy but once I got the hang of it everything went pretty well. My second semester I had to take I believe it was six classes one of which was an eight week. Then her and my dad have the nerve to complain about me staying up till 3.a.m in the morning almost every night. Keep in mind that was while dealing with unmedicated ADHD. Then instead of allowing me to take the summer off my mother notifies me that she signed me up for a summer class which may have not been to bad but it’s human A&amp;P and of course because of issues with the program I missed a weeks worth of assignments dropping my grade to a 44 (I contacted my teacher and I am still waiting for her to allow me access or just say no about four weeks later) and I have only yesterday gotten it back up to a passing grade. It does not help that my teacher appears to well not know how to do her job either. She only has eight students including me yet has only responded to one of my four emails and I still need a second response. She recently made an exam and put the due date as March 1 and the class started June 1 with the other assignments for that set of chapters due July 12. Our first test that she made and that wasn’t automatically made for her had the possible answers ordered with the correct one always first but hay free points so at least there is that. Then there are others with questions that have all but one answer input. Then there’s her sending me an email telling me to respond ASAP because I have assignments that are due soon when 1 those assignments are cleared marked no due date, and 2 she did even put them on the schedule, you had to go into modules to access them instead of just going through the schedule which is what ever other teacher so far has had me do and to be honest going through modules is just annoying more than anything else. Oh did I mention she never responded to me? So yeah I hope when I go off to uni it will be better than this crap. But on the bright side excluding the last class I’ve maintained a 3.0 so that’s something.

268,ohs7v4,2021-07-10 22:21:28,CollegeRant,People who complain about online classes arent listening to the students who actually like the virtual college experience.,"I get it. Theres a lot of people that dont like online classes ; think that it doesnt equate to what they paid for / learning. But here me out. 

I really like online classes. I work partially full time sometimes part time week by week. Being able to do my online classes with a employer who doesnt care about my education is beneficial to me keeping my job. Additionally, I actually enjoy not having to live near or on campus. The overpriced rent, the people who dont know how to drive and the constant drama or students in class that would interrupt a lecture over something quite trivial. In my experience online classes was a overall benefit to myself. It is important however to note that there is a large swath of people who prefer in person classes and that is okay. But as i suspect there are many people like me that have to work for a living to pay for aspects of college without any family help. That I am internally a introvert and just hate some of the aspects that come with loud overcrowding on main campus during Greek life events. While prices should be less for online tutition there are two types of college students.

269,of7cek,2021-07-07 00:00:44,CollegeRant,Final test messed up my grade,"I took a finance class for my minor over this Summer 1 semester. There were quizzes and homework’s due every week and two exams total. I was super proud of myself in this class as I don’t really care much for math but I made all A’s on all of my assignments and a 93 on my first exam. My average was a 95 before Monday when I took the second exam and ran out of time. My grade for this exam ended up being  a 68.75, just one question short of maintaining my A average. Because of this my grade dropped to an 89.1 and my professor won’t round anything that wouldn’t round up in excel. I’ve honestly been struggling a lot these past few semesters with everything being online and having to work a lot and my gpa has suffered. I took these summer classes to help boost my gpa and here I am falling short of an A because of one test. It’s so frustrating that you can do so well all semester and one poor grade ruins the whole thing. I also want to mention that I studied very hard for both exams and am not just lazy and didn’t try hard enough at the end. I just honestly didn’t have enough time. Getting anything less than an A has such heavy weight on your gpa so it’s frustrating when you barely miss it and the professors never seem to care when you try to talk to them.",6,1,rijhulo

Because of that he marked them late and changed my grade to a C. I kept saying that I turned them into the box but he seemed to accuse me of not paying attention to his directions on where to drop off work.

(I am not sure he knew what he was doing it was always like he was lecturing from a script, couldn't answer questions and acted holier then tho on fucking webx and in emails. 

 I have another professor who talking to is like yelling at a wall more so when you know this class is very packet tracer centered that is a rapidly compounding issue. (Network people will get how imperfect PT can be at times....)  Don't get me wrong I know that its a right of passage to work on something in PT until your eyes burn when blinking and are one ip domain-lookup (command typo) away from throwing your laptop/key bored across the room.

Then there is my ethics professor, aside from some wildly offensive and absurdly tone deaf comments in the course text book, which he ""wrote"". (I wish I could post screen caps here, not going to but wish I could.) gives us these very vague simple  instructions, then expects us to write papers that fall into this very very narrow ideal.  I just don't get what he wants, no matter what I try he just doesn't cut any slack, yes I have asked about this before.

280,o3xsxx,2021-06-20 04:45:29,CollegeRant,I have bipolar. College is a pain in the ass.,"So right now I'm 27, I've struggled with bipolar my whole life but I was only diagnosed when I was 26. I have bipolar type 1 rapid cycling F31.12. I see a therapist twice or more a week, see a psychiatrist at least once a month, and after seeing several psychologists about this: they've all said this isn't something that will ever go away or probably even be easy to manage. I'm going to always struggle with some extreme mood swings that go to levels most people can't even comprehend and I'm always going to struggle with mania and sometimes full-on psychotic episodes just because that's just the shitty way I was born.  


So when I graduated high school I wanted to go to Calarts which is a school I've always wanted to go to since I was like ten. I didn't have the best grades in the world and my father refused to sign my fafsa forms so even if I got into Calarts, I couldn't afford it period, so I decided to go take some semesters in community college. First semester I didn't do too bad in, I ended up with a 2.75 GPA, but my bipolar problems that I was already struggling with began to really kick into overdrive and I quit college altogether because I felt like I was smarter than everyone there and could make millions on my own and started doing my own freelance related animation work. I actually had some decent success in this and worked on some animated pilots but I slowly lost my mind completely and I ended up being homeless, turned into this insane vagrant type of character, began trainhopping all over the country, would have a daily get rich quick scheme that typically involved me going into an apple store and basically scamming people online, started having legit psychotic episodes one of which included me stomping around Manhattan in a snowstorm wearing nothing but my underwear believing that I was an alien put inside of a robot body and I was sent here to survive a reality TV show, and like... I was nuts. A few years later during a moment of sanity, I looked at myself and said enough is enough, I get a job working at Target for a few years, ended up getting my own insurance, and eventually decided to see a psychologist and look at that it turns out I have a pretty horrible mental illness that has been screwing me over in ways I couldn't ever understand until that point.  


So fast forward after a year and what was considered intensive treatment, I decide I wanna go back to school summer of 2020 just because I've always wanted to fulfill that dream of having that damned diploma and being part of Calarts even if I don't need it per se.  I decide go back to the same community college in order to save money and also get my GPA up so i can get some scholarships and I take a sociology class and a philosophy class and I'm doing really well in both of them and have close to a perfect grade thus far. It was a week where in both classes we needed to work on our final papers and bam I suddenly have an extreme depressive episode and I'm basically in the corner of my room curled up in the corner and rotting and not even eating anything or drinking anything for a day or two. Suddenly I had a massive mood swing which got me up and doing things about but instead of coming back to normal, I start going full-blown hardcore manic and decide I'm going to write the greatest papers known to mankind and waaaaaaaaaaaaay overdo them despite the fact that both of my professors stated the only wanted around five or six pages but I had decided that wasn't enough and I was going insane and writing like twenty or more pages. This plan completely backfired and I didn't get my sociology paper in on time so it was an F and my philosophy professor, even though he said it was a very good paper, took off a significant amount of points for not following directions with the length or even the subject matter. So both my grades went from As to a C and a B overnight because of that.  


Fall classes happen and I'm taking an art history class which, on paper, I should theoretically be great in due to my history with doing art, a literature class, and a trigonometry course. Like the previous semester, I'm doing really well in them at first however this time, instead of getting depressed first I ended up going manic/somewhat psychotic during these online classes. I don't know how to fully describe what it's like to not be lazy, not be distracted, and be paying full attention in a math class and still bomb it despite math being one of my favorite things, but I did and it's largely because of the fact I just wasn't there mentally. It's worth noting that I didn't fail all the tests, some of them I did really well in, I just messed up the ones that were important enough to the overall class and it screwed my grade up. It was the same thing with my art history class where I knew a lot of these artists already but I was just going so insane that I managed to bomb everything I'd turn in or I wouldn't get it complete in time, not because of time management problems, but literally me just not being totally sane. Ironically I did really well in my English class \*because\* of that ludicrous insanity and my professor actually really appreciated the very sharp comments and super in-depth analysis things I'd do of our literature for the assignments but just like the sociology class, I got super depressed during that final exam and I ended up not submitting it in time and my grade in that class went from an A to a C overnight.   


I've been basically bouncing with a 1.68 GPA right now and of the past three classes I've taken, I've only really passed one of them.  I've withdrawn from a lot of classes so it's not \*quite\* the end of the world as it would only take retaking some failed classes and getting at least an A in one of the classes I got a C in to really fix it. That said, it's still difficult and this whole thing frustrates me because even if I have a small little episode and I'm able to catch myself before things get too off-balance, a lot of times it's just too late to do anything about it and my grade for that class is basically screwed even if I got a perfect score on everything else submitted afterward. Heck right now I'm supposed to be retaking my sociology class for a better grade but I'm going to have to drop out of it all together because I somehow managed to fuck up to the point of not even fully realizing class was going on and missed the first week and I tried this week to really save that but it was just too late and even though the class isn't over, I did the math and it's just too late.  


Some people have told me only take one class a semester but with the nature of this weird disorder, it's like it doesn't exactly matter how many classes I'm taking because this isn't about it being too hard to manage as much as it's about me being mentally sane if that makes any sense. Every so often I'll have someone try and politely say I'm a fuckup and that college isn't for me and I obviously wanna just say fuck you to that but at the same time, someone shared a statistic with me where bipolar people pass college less than 10% of the time and of those 10% it's predominantly people with a lesser and more manageable form of the disorder, not the crazy shit I have, so yeah it is true that college technically isn't for someone like me because the way everything is set up is not in my favor.  Unfortunately, that's just the situation I'm in BUT I'm dedicated to not quitting because I don't fucking care how, I want to just actually do something I've dreamt about since I was a kid and also to spite a lot of teachers I had growing up as a kid who thought I had autism and outright told me things like ""you'll never amount to anything because you're just not wired right""  


It's just frustrating as fuck though because I know total dumbfucks who've been able to pass college with flying colors and I also know plenty of lazy shits who've played their cards right and were able to get through college without much issue. I'm not stupid and I'm not lazy but fucking hell I hate this because, without any real context of this disorder, it sure looks like I'm somehow both at once. I've finally decided to suck it up and contact the student disability service center at my community college and see if there's any type of help or assistance I can get for something like this, but since I'm having these episodes seemingly without any triggers that I can even identify, I'm not sure how far that's gonna go.   


TL;DR I'll be doing really well in a college class and then I'll have a bipolar episode and either fuck up so hard I fail the class or fuck up in a way that severely lowers my grade. Sometimes I'm able to catch it, sometimes I'm not.

I'd like to preface this by saying that this is more of a rant than anything else. I'm sure I'm one of hundreds of thousands of students who have had this problem, but nevertheless, I felt like I needed to get it out of my system.

I'm taking two online summer courses right now, one in Contemporary Mathematics and another in French. The condensed format of both courses makes it quite difficult to retain the information I'm being given in the amount of time that I have to learn it.

However, I'd have to say that my biggest problem right now is with Contemporary Mathematics due to the fact that 80% of the grade is weighted toward exams, of which there are four. Spending 3 to 5 hours a day working on the abundance of homework and quizzes (each of which is only 10% of my overall grade respectively) only to have my 95% grade drop down to a 75% because of one 10 question exam that I spent not even an hour of my time working on.

It just really kills my motivation to do my best in this class when the vast majority of what I spend my time working tirelessly on ends up only being worth a flimsy percentage of my grade. Regardless, I'm just going to keep on doing what I can and hope that my grasp of the concepts being taught is stronger by the time that the next exam comes around (7 days from now, lol).

283,nzi7gr,2021-06-14 08:38:03,CollegeRant,I’m having nightmares about college even during summer break,"First of all, I want to apologize for any mistakes I might do since english is not my native language.

I study at a capital university in Europe, and as the title says I’ve been having nightmares about college that keep me awake the rest of the night feeling horribly anxious. 

I started my classes completely motivated for the material and even doing research on my own but the more I deal with my professors and my university, the worse I feel. 

Some of the things happening in my class and/or college:

- Some professors express clear favoritism when dealing with certain students (we’re a small class of around 25) and it reflects on their grades

- Grade manipulation (Professor gave 3 more values than the real final grade for one student. Tests count 50% each. We can see each other’s test grades)

- The same professor corrects tests in one afternoon. We finished in the morning and by 3pm, the results were out. He corrected 60 development questions in a couple hours. Each question required a minimum of 2 written pages by hand. For the first test he corrected 90.

- Same professor again decided to do a in-person test after we only had horrible online classes. We told him we were having lots of difficulties understanding the material and expressed concerns over the test, the result was a harder test compared to other years and majority of scores under 10 (the maximum being 20, 10 is the minimum to pass).

- Other professor was unreachable. They would take 1-2 months to reply to an e-mail asking for instructions (they didn’t teach anything either, their classes felt completely self-taught)

- Bibliography given in other languages that students can’t speak or read. When asked if there was anything else in english or our language, we were just told to learn the language by taking classes in university. Each language module costs 200€. 

- Some professors don’t have a syllabus and when there’s one they don’t respect it.

- Sometimes they dump material on us the day before a test. 

- Our tests are not anonymous and are corrected by the professor (there are no assistants or anything, only one professor per class). They’re graded based on what the professor considers the best answer from all of the students. We have no access to correction or any test. 

- Internships that feel like modern day slavery. We don’t get paid, not even transport or food, depending on the case. If accommodations are included, expect the worst. Generally dirty mattresses, sometimes on the floor. They’re mandatory to do. It feels like they don’t want to pay for actual workers so they make students do it. 

- Same professor that corrects tests in a couple hours, went on a 1 hour rant after we expressed concern over how classes were being taught (he only reads his powerpoints, they’re not full of text, they’re made in a “shopping list” style). He told us we were destroying college education, among other insane things. There’s footage of this but I don’t believe we can even show it to university due to privacy laws.

This and among other things going on have been making me feel horrible. I usually try to ignore it and just focus on my education, but even on summer break I have nightmares that make me feel miserable. The only motivation I have is to get into Master’s in another university. I hate my major now. The professors seem more confused than students, the only difference is that some professors have a superiority complex. I dread my university and I only want out.

285,nwqw5l,2021-06-10 15:48:00,CollegeRant,Overloaded schedule + Professors with strange teaching practices = Burned out,"Hi, I found this subreddit a while back and I feel like it might be a good place to talk about the previous semester. I meant to post this a while back, but I forgot about it. If it matters, this is my first year at a college I transferred to after graduating from a two year college. It is long. A TLDR is available at the bottom.

I came back home from my dorm close to a month ago, where I doubled with another student I didn't know before moving in with. College was on campus for most of the year save for a few days (first week of classes was remote). Typical protocols were in place like testing, masks, and social distancing, which wasn't all that bad, and I didn't get sick. I also got both rounds of the vaccine during the semester. I had lots of reasons to get the vaccines, but I believe my college will want to see my shot card before I get my room key.

I guess most of the pain came from this past semester - I was told that I would have to take six classes for the next two semesters to graduate next May. I managed to find one of my classes over this summer and am working on that right now.

Before I get started, I am going to be deliberately vague about what these classes were. All classes were taught by six different professors.

Of my six classes, I had three good ones. One was a subject I love so it didn't feel like work, and two more were with really good teachers. Then there were the other classes. One had a professor that was cleared to be off campus for classes. He never held lecture, just ""Hi! No lectures. This is the textbook, read Ch. 1 before next session. Email me if you need help."" To be clear, I signed up for a physical class. I understand not being able to make it to campus, but I did not like having no lecture. The other one I blame myself on a little bit. This was an online class with a major paper assigned halfway into the semester that I had to hit the gas on a few weeks before the semester ended. It made it into the in-bin on time and I got a decent score. This was a mostly textbook class too.

Then there's the last class. This class was later in the day with a topic that is not my forte. It never has been. Some things that the professor taught I found fun to learn. Notes were another thing, the professor go through the slides quite fast for certain topics. Some of the things in class were not well discussed like how to do certain tasks in a specific system. I had a D and an F on the first two tests, respectively. Part of that I can pin on myself because I didn't study well for that class' exams and not reading the text for that class as thoroughly as I should have. Some complained about the ways he wrote tests, I believe.

There was a group project that was to be done for that class, and I joined an awesome group that worked diligently to figure things out and we managed to get a rough project in. We got a great grade, even if my side was a little spotty. I went down one letter grade on that assignment for not submitting something I thought that only one person had to send in - apparently everyone had to do it. It was on the rubric, and something I did not look at extensively. I was debating sending an appeal to my professor about that, because he did not explicitly warn us about this in class. I flip-flopped on my decision after messaging my teammates about what happened, but I decided that I would probably be rejected because I didn't read the rubric carefully. Since it is after the semester, there's nothing I can do now. At the same time, I understand college is not supposed to spoon feed everything to you, but I feel like that was a petty move. But in the end, at least I passed that class with a good letter grade.

This was an exhausting semester. Not to mention, two days out of the week, I had a ten hour day (two back to back in the morning, an hour for lunch, then two classes separated by two hours). I wish I could have spread them out more (the other days during the week only had one class) but I guess that's how it is.  I feel like that is one the reasons why I feel burnt out after this semester. 

I found out one of my required classes was available online, and I signed up for it. This should make next semester a little easier, so five classes instead of six. 

TLDR: I had a less than great experience doing six classes at the same time. Several classes were especially tough, especially one professor with a teaching strategy that I did not like at all. I overall feel burnt out. I found one class online and now I should have less of a burden in the fall. I have a year of college left, and once I am done, I want a job.",2,1,tomato_fries
286,nvbcey,2021-06-08 18:50:56,CollegeRant,Feel like going back to university was a complete mistake and a joke,"Sorry if this is long-winded. I just have so much to say and vent about.
I decided to come back to university four years ago, have been here three. I am literally just about to graduate this summer as long as I don't mess up so yay!!! There's the positive.

Here's the long, long negative. I did running start in high school, get okay grades, continued after I graduated and got way better. Got my AA transfer degree. I'm poor, so I decided to take a break before going to university to make an nest egg. I ended up working in a pharmacy, loved it, got an internship for certified pharmacy technician and absolutely crushed and nailed it! I decided I wanted to continue my education, and moved to what was known as the best university here in my state. When I came back and transferred, they literally took the worst of my transfer degree grades and not all the A's and B's I had under my belt, but whatever I thought at the time. These are all classes that count towards my degree and get me that much closer. My GPA to start with was not great. I'm a double major in history and biological sciences. My history degree and classes I've never had a problem with. But the sciences, these classes are sometimes complete hell. They massacred my gpa. Mainly chemistry. Granted, I am somewhat terrible with chemistry, but these classes were all about memorization and not how to work with the chemistry itself. There are two fantastic professors who I was successful with, as I actually learned the material. The others would literally waste their lecture times talking about disneyland, movies, and whatever else didn't have anything to do with science. These classes are around $1,800 each! I did use tutors, khan academy and self-taught a lot of the material, but it just didn't stick as well. And then the exams always had nothing to do with anything we learned. Anyways, I was hanging in there until covid came along. Then everything was online. My grades were all over the place. Our o-chem class though was the worst. I did my absolute best, and honestly I'm very proud of all the hard work! At the end of the semester, I ended up with a high D. We can see the percentages and averages of all the exams, and I knew I was in the upper half. I emailed her asking if there was anything that can be done, and also submitted the anonymous course evaluation where I talked about how this class was all about memorization, not much to do with what we learned and by far did not allow the students to demonstrate their understanding of the material. The chemistry board agreed with this, even using my quote as a small reason for their decision to curve the grade up literally 30% for everyone but mainly blamed the covid situation for the poor grades. In other classes, the course space would sometimes just not upload your assignments after GIVING US THE CONFIRMATION it did! I ended up emailing them a lot, but we are using an outlook that is customized for our university. It too likes to eat emails, to which one of my favorite professors went on a fifteen minute rant about how shes missed so many important emails because of it.
Now in my last semester, the course space we use is all sorts of more messed up than the previous semester. An ENTIRE class was just randomly deleted over a week, with our first exam being due that week. It took another week to get the course space back together. We only have eight weeks for this summer class. That was a lot of valuable time lost. The professor was beyond pissed, he demanded we be compensated. The tech and school board basically said, well it's not our fault. Work around it.

On my personal note, these semesters left me with not stellar grades, as I was also dealing with medical problems and family loss, to which they also had the attitude of not their fault and I should deal with it. So, here I am trying. My gpa wasn't where they wanted it to be, so I am technically under academic dismissal but am in my last semester anyways. The literal three classes I needed to retake to get my gpa WAY back up where it should be weren't even offered until this summer semester (over a year and a half since the last ones were) and are the last classes I need to graduate. I find myself not even caring anymore about the university itself and hold absolute no pride in my university. I am proud of how hard I've worked, what I've learned and how much I've grown and adapted in my own way. I also do not regret trying to actually learn the material for the classes rather than the memorization game almost all the exams were in the end. I did and do still take responsibility for my, quite frankly, fuck ups with the science classes. And take pride in that too. I learned, I adapted. And then the world changed to online, and I relearned again.

If there are others in a similar boat, I'm so sorry but so proud of you! You're doing your best! And they can't take that away from you.",2,1,ThrowAway80942
287,nv9bbx,2021-06-08 17:19:31,CollegeRant,I need to rant. Please read if you are good at life advice.,"I am having one of your classic college student crises. I am just a dramatic 20 year old, and most people on here likely have problems much bigger than mine, but I just need to rant.

I never thought I'd be the person that would be going into their Junior year of college, still unsure about their major, and what they want to do upon graduation. I pitied those people at one point. But now, I am one.

I did very well in High School, I was an overachiever, I had good grades, and I did many extracurricular activities and sports. You know the type. I was not by any means the valedictorian, or an Ivy League competitor, but I was your classic public high school in a middle class town ""smart girl."" The main point here is that I did not have to try in High School. I got good grades, and I did not develop good study habits. And, I was a little overly confident about my brains and abilities going into college.

I got into some very good colleges, and even some of my reach schools, and was denied from only one school that was admittedly very out of my range. My parents are paying for my college, which I am very grateful for. They said I could go to whatever college, and they would figure it out. I really wanted to go to this one private university in Pennsylvania, but I did not receive any financial aid. Tuition alone would be around 60K/year. I knew they couldn't afford that, even though they said they would make it work. I liked the public university in the state I live in ALMOST just as much as that school, plus it was the safer option. Everyone in my family was secretly hoping I would go to my state school. On top of that, my Dad works there, so I would receive a tuition waiver, on top of my other merit aid. Although they would be okay with whatever college I chose, I would feel incredibly selfish not choosing the state school that was the cheaper option that everyone wanted. And I liked it too. Maybe it wasn't my first choice, or the more adventurous option, but I would decide to go there, and I love it. I am now a Junior at this University and it is great. But I still wonder what my life would be like if I had chosen to go somewhere else. Either my top choice, or somewhere else more adventurous, prestigious, or out of state. Regardless, this is where I am and I don't have regrets. 

I have never had any idea ""what I want to do when I grow up."" All I ever knew, was that I was good in school and pretty good at everything I tried. And that I was not passionate about any particular thing. I just wanted to make good money, and travel. The medical field has always been in the back of my mind, and secretly in my heart, but I knew the type of money I was trying to accomplish would not be in the medical field. 

There are doctors in my family, and they are overworked and underpaid. My Mom wanted me to think about my future as a wife and mother, and pick a career accordingly. I did not do that. I never considered nursing, even though I should have. I have an interest in medicine, I want a family, and I had the grades to get into Nursing school. In hindsight, it was perfect. For some strange reason, I felt that would limit me. I wanted to pick the hardest major, with the hardest classes, still leaving room for many different careers and choices, since I still was not completely sure what I wanted to do as a career. Nursing is not easy by any means, but my narrow minded High School self thought that I could, and should, do ""better"" than that.

Like I said, I was overly confident about how smart I was and how I would ""naturally"" do well in all my classes. So, I decided to go in with basically the hardest major. Computer Science Engineering. I did pretty poorly my first semester, because I was not trying my best, and I was making a lot of friends and not prioritizing my schoolwork. That is my fault. Part of the problem is also that I did not truly enjoy Computer Science. I thought it would be easy to get through college, easy to get a high paying job, and I would be able to cruise through life. But that is not the reality. Don't go for a career you know you won't enjoy, just because it will make you money and you can do things you enjoy outside of work. Everyone told me that, but I convinced myself that I could learn to like Computer Science. I not only did not like it, but I found the first thing in my life that I was not naturally good at, and could not force myself to be good at. That was definitely a humbling wake-up call. 

I decided to switch to Biomedical Engineering. I got my grades up. I like my classes, and I'm going to be a Junior in the fall. But do I really want to be a Biomedical Engineer? Do I even know what a Biomedical Engineer is/does? The answer to both those questions is ""I don't know."" I am going to be a Junior and I still have all of this confusion and I hate it.

I wish I could just pick something that I like, and am good at, because I would work so hard at being the best I can be in that field. The problem is, I can't focus on being the best I can be because I am holding onto so many other possibilities. If I commit fully to Biomedical Engineering, then I have to let go of the possibilities of Medical school and PA school, that are still in my mind. I have to let go of the possibilities of doing something artistic, and doing something with law enforcement. I have to let go of my childhood aspirations of being an astronaut or a pilot. These are all job interests I have had, and have stayed in the back of my mind. I have never, and still can't, commit to just ONE of my wildest dreams, even though some of them are so wild. If I don't commit to one, I will never accomplish any of them, but if I do commit to just one, I might accomplish one, but at the cost of all of the others. The what-if's of life are my fatal flaw.

I am a hard worker, I know that. I like to stay busy. One of the biggest reasons that I thought I could be successful in any field, is that I am hardworking. The other big reason: I am good with people, and I love people. I thought that no matter what I am doing, and where I am working, as long as I'm around people, coworkers, and can meet people, I will be happy. I still believe that. 

2.5 semesters of my 4 total semesters of college experience were altered because of COVID. I was fortunate enough to live on campus, and live a somewhat normal college life. But still, the what-ifs kill me. I know this is a universal experience, and I'm not the only one who lived through a pandemic, trust me. I need to stress that so many people have it so much worse. It is terrible to complain, but I wonder what my college experience would have been like if more than half of it was not masked and quarantined and online. I wanted to study abroad, but now due to the Engineering curriculum, I can't study abroad in Europe for a semester, which I have dreamed about since I was a kid. Oh well. Would I have more friends? Would I have a better GPA? Would I be more motivated to work out? I don't know the answers to any of these questions, but they cross my mind daily.

The summer after my Freshman year I worked as a waitress. I loved the people I worked with, and the environment. I did not ""love"" every aspect being a waitress to grumpy rich people in the hot sun, but I truly enjoyed my time there. I was sick of it by the time the summer was over, though. 

This summer, I am working in a Research Lab as an intern. On paper, this was a great idea. Research experience is fantastic in a field like Biomedical Engineering. It could even help me get into Medical School if that is what I decide to do. The subject matter in this lab interests me, and it will look great on a resume. It will help me get an internship next summer, and if I do well there, I will hopefully get a job at that company or a different company, with a solid Engineering starting salary when I get out of college. 

This research internship is lonely. I only interact with a few older people. I miss the hustle and bustle of waitressing, and the environment of being around people my age, and being around new people in general. I can't help but imagine that working in a hospital with patients (as a nurse, doctor, etc.) would have that similar hustle and bustle, and constantly being surrounded by people. That being said, I know this internship is good for my future, whatever that may be, I am learning a lot, and I am interested in what I am learning. 

I so badly wish that I could believe myself when I say that I want to be a Biomedical Engineer. I am on the right track. I have a good internship and experiences, and I am having a great time in college. I wish I could say that this is what I really want to be doing. But I am so preoccupied with the past and the future that I cannot live in the present. The more time that goes by, I fear that I am inevitably digging myself into a deeper hole of what-ifs. There are so many what-ifs behind me, and I just know that the deeper I get into this career path, the more what-ifs I'll have about other fields.

I'm only getting older, and although I have time to figure out what I want to do, I don't have forever. What I really want in a career is a job that makes me feel smart, makes good money, has many opportunities for growth, allows me to work with people, and allows me to help people. I also want a life outside of my career in which I can have a family, help people outside of work, travel, and pursue hobbies and ""side-jobs.""

I am not going to keep changing career paths until I get out of this mindset, because it is always going to be there. So, I don't know what to do. Will I ever feel satisfied and fulfilled with truly no regrets?

TL;DR So, yeah. I'm a Biomedical Engineering major at a State school. I'm smart-ish, super involved on campus, decent amount of friends. No clue what I want to do for a job, only because there is so much that I want to do. I have too many interests, and committing to one thing causes the what-ifs of my life to consume me.",11,1,Objective-Tea-2158

289,ntbjso,2021-06-06 02:31:06,CollegeRant,Someone copied my discussion board post. Should I report it? *Read desc. for context*,"Hey everyone! This is my first post on reddit. I apologize if my formatting is off.

For context, I am taking an online class with a new professor. The class is small with only 10 students. My university requires all professors to use Blackboard, but my professor doesn’t know how to use it well. She has us post all of our assignments on the discussion board. We had a case study due this week which was 6-10 pages typed. Responding to others in this class is optional, but I always read other posts to see if there is anything interesting to respond to. In reading others, I noticed one was quite similar to mine, word for word and some words changed around. My writing is quite distinct and I always make it a point to write things in my own words. Moreover, I had a long reference page for this assignment and she did not cite anything. Out of curiosity, I ran my assignment against hers using Copy Leaks. It came back being about 20% similar. (I took a screenshot of the results just in case)

   I was the first one who posted this assignment to the board and hers was last. I have no idea who this girl is. She was able to access my paper because our professor has us post everything to the discussion board. For anyone who doesn't know, Blackboard has a setting where professors can require students to post first before viewing other student's posts. Because my professor does not have this setting, everyone can see what you wrote before they post their own assignment. 

  I am super pissed. I also have horrible anxiety and I am concerned that my professor will think that I passed my assignment on to this girl to copy. I am a rising senior with plans to go to grad school and I don't need some entitled, lazy, person to come and sabotage that for me. I have a 3.85 GPA and have been on the deans list every semester since my freshman year. At the same time, I am not sure if I should bring this up to the professor. I don't want to be a snitch or cause any drama. What should I do? 

TLDR-Someone copied my assignment from a discussion board. Judging by previous posts, this isn't the first time she has done this. For anyone who doesn't know, Blackboard has a setting where professors can require students to post first before viewing other student's posts. Because my professor does not have this setting, everyone can see what you wrote before they post their own assignment. Copy Leaks said the assignment was significantly similar to mine. I am unsure of if I should report this to the professor or wait to see what she says when she grades the assignment.",9,1,ghostgal127
290,nsplrb,2021-06-05 06:39:52,CollegeRant,The negative consequences of covid in addition to life feel like they have just been piling on and I’m just tired of it.,"Let me start this off saying I’m a pretty decent student when in person classes are going on. I had all A’s my freshman year before covid hit and it completely destroyed any semblance of structure I had in my life. 

     I am a horrible online student not being able to find the motivation to study things I enjoy let alone things that I do not. And it feels as if life has just been piling things up on top of me. 
     I transferred universities after my freshman year of college as was my initial plan but in hindsight I’m not sure if it was the best plan. I have not been able to make any new friends and I feel isolated. I want to branch out but it has just been so hard with covid. My roommates are amazing but I feel like I’m piggybacking off of them I I hang out with their friend groups and I hate being a burden. 

     On top of all that I was applying to my major this semester and I had to maintain a certain GPA to have a chance to get in. Well, 2 weeks before final exams my mother passed away. One of my professors thankfully pushed back my exam and was extremely understanding. However, one professor would only push my exam back if I could take it two days later in person, but I live 2 1/2 hours away. This caused me to drop from a B to a C+ in the class putting me below the required GPA cut off.

     I then received an email from the department saying I would have one attempt to reapply and it had to be this fall semester. The only issue is two of the classes I need to reapply are completely full at my campus and I have to drive an hour each way to the satellite campus twice a week. If they even allow me to take those classes. If I cannot take those classes I have to have a 4.0 GPA to have a chance to make it into my major. With those two classes I need a 3.3. 

I just feel like there is so much going on and it’s like life is conspiring against me (which obviously isn’t the case it just feels like it). I just needed to rant.",2,1,GlorifiedPinecone
291,nrtjc4,2021-06-04 01:37:09,CollegeRant,Prof. just gave me a D in a class where I earned a C,"Overall, this professor is a good enough teacher. I understand it is online and it's sort of hard to teach in this environment. I certainly did a lot worse than normal this semester due to everything going on and ended class with a C. I checked on canvas and it was a C.  I've been okay with this grade as she literally has 0 A's in the whole class.

 I was paying for my classes on the school website and she already put my grade in as a D and I took the final yesterday and got a passing grade, and my overall grade was even higher than it was earlier. I emailed her, and she hasn't responded for roughly 6 hours. I went through the syllabus too, and I found the issue.

 There is a tiny sentence in the middle of the syllabus that says ""you must pass more than half the tests to pass the class"". I didn't know this, and my grades for the 4 tests we took were 59%, 69%, 74%, and 75% for the final.  

I know I didn't do good on the first 2 tests, but I think that especially because it's online, only by 1%, nearly her whole entire class is failing, no one is excelling in the class, AND I HAVE A C I deserve to at least get a C!!

I would be less pissed off too if she just told me all the way back in April that it was impossible to pass the class so I can at least drop it, but now not only is my GPA murdered, but my entire degree is pushed back nearly a year because I'm trying to do a 3-year course in 2 years and I can only transfer in the fall semester. I've been taking extra classes and 17 unit semesters and keeping a 3.6 and it all is probably gonna get ruined by 1 point for a policy that I didn't even know about.

I signed up for an online accelerated calculus 3 class; not sure if that was a wise choice. I couldn't handle the pace, on top of that, my teacher spoke in broken English and mumbled so much that replaying the videos was not helpful. Kept on getting grades as low as 30-40.

I want to know if this was the right call. I've been feeling so stressed and now feel like I let my parents down. They said it's fine and despite feeling a huge burden being lifted off my soul something tells me that I don't have much time left and should hurry so I can make a living and start a family.

294,nqed9w,2021-06-02 05:31:35,CollegeRant,Why I am struggling so much in college and why I spam so much,"I don't want to write an essay, but I have to talk about my issues in life. I am struggling, and I am not going to sugarcoat it. I am going to give context for all of my actions.

I take sole responsibility for all of my issues in life. I struggle to make good decisions. My parents spoiled me in my childhood, and all of my teachers said I was a good kid in high school. That damaged me mentally. I never had to do chores, so I never learned responsibility or consequences. Throughout my life, I have a tendency to take what others say and the actions of others to an extreme. I am a sensitive person emotionally.

It all started with pre-school, where I did not enjoy it and was happy when I see my parents pick me up every time they came. I also never really hanged out with my peers, so I never really developed good social skills with other kids.

Kindergarten eventually came along, and I remembered clearly on the first day of school right after my parents dropped me off, I tried running out of school back to my parents because I did not want to go into a such a foreign environment. However, the teachers caught me and I stayed in class. Throughout the year, I got more comfortable with school, but I never really hang out with other peers. One thing I remembered was that Kindergarten was the grade where I started to realize how emotionally sensitive I was. I remembered one time being put in timeout because I wanted to play with toy trains so badly I rushed through a piece of classwork without putting much care in it. I remembered crying badly about it, and that is how I started to develop a tendency to be highly sensitive.

Throughout my life is that I never socialized with others. I will admit that numerous times throughout K-12, other kids tried to talk to me, but I just ignored them. That is how I never developed any friendships. I have absolutely no social skills, and I have become increasingly cynical of the world and viewed everyone with major distrust. Part of the reason why I post all over Reddit is because I crave attention because I was spoiled in my childhood and never understood the word ""no"". During elementary school, I always hanged out by myself during breaks. I never played or interacted well with anyone. During my final years of elementary school, I started to get cynical with the world because I took things too personally. If a teacher punished me for misbehavior, I took it to sensitively and started to overreact and develop the feeling that being evil was natural even though that was not true. I remembered this particularly in around 4th grade where I got put in time out because I didn't show work on math homework. I remembered crying heavily because I was extremely sensitive. I would often start to yell and be aggressive in elementary school to the point where the teacher forced me to see a counselor because of my issues. I just told the counselor I had no issues and wanted to go back to class. When I got a report card at the end of the year talking about how poor my behavior was, I started to understand that yelling was not okay and adjusted by once for all completely shut myself socially. I thought if I was quiet, I would never get in trouble again. However, my parents did not discipline me at home, so I continued to act rude, impolite, and aggressive at home.

In middle school, I continued to never socialized with anyone. I continued to be a ""weirdo"". I chose to instead solely focused on academics. My parents started to force me to do clubs and placed a lot of stress on me because they told me I needed to work hard to succeed in life. All of that stress and pressure made it hard for me to survive throughout middle school without a ton of stress. I continued to be highly sensitive and was not able to take criticism well. Personally in middle school, I struggled a lot in English class because I hated reading. That is part of the reason why I started to develop an interest for STEM. My parents also started to become deeply worried about my socialization and kept asking why I never made any friends, but I never really talked about that with my parents. I started to distance myself from them.

However, I did manage to do well in all of my classes with a ton of struggling and was seen as a good kid by my teachers. For once, I accomplished something in my life that was good so that was my high point. I also had more freedom in middle school and started to explore the giant world known as the Internet. I enjoyed watching YouTube about all sorts of topics. My main interests at the time were video games and aviation. I also started to develop an obsession with the military and started to become interested in that. However, I grew out of that by around 8th grade. Another thing to note in middle school was PE. I hated PE. We did all sorts of activities like basketball, volleyball, dodgeball, and more. I hated all of them and I was terrible at them. I never really had any interests in sports, so I never tried. I was the inactive kid. However, one thing I did remember about PE was that I did enjoy sprinting when we had a couple of weeks dedicated to track and field. I remember doing well and another kid telling me I should do track. That was something that stuck with me.

I eventually finished middle school, was told I was a good kid and spoiled by all of my teachers, and went on to high school. This is where things started to go downhill in my life emotionally. I also forgot to mention that middle school was when I started to develop a very bad case of acne. It got so bad to the point where we had to see the doctor numerous times and wasted a ton of money in doing so. This is how I started to become cynical of the healthcare system. I don't trust doctors in terms of fixing my health issues.

I remembered during high school orientation before I started my first year in high school, we had an assembly in the gym. A teacher gave us a presentation that high school only lasted for four years, and you need to take advantage of it. High school wasn't only just about academics. It is also a time to have fun. The teacher told us we need to take part in sports, go to dances, have fun, make memories, and more. In my head, I mentally said ""no"" because I wanted to remain by myself and just focus on academics because I was solely focused on getting into college at that point. My parents were still worried about how I was not social, but I still didn't socialize with my peers.

Throughout my freshman year of high school, besides classes, I participated in one club. That was it. I was not heavily involved in high school extracurriculars because I just wanted to focus on academics. I continued to be the weird kid that sits in the corner during lunch. Around spring of 2017, there was some random guy that randomly talking to me. Looking back, it was clear that he saw I was lonely and tried to socialize with me. However, I was extremely cynical, didn't want to be social, so I didn't really respond to him besides a bunch of nodding and shaking my head. He eventually just left me alone. Throughout the year, we also had a bunch of pep rallies. I heard a bunch of other kids at the time talk about how pep rallies sucked and were a waste of time, but I personally loved them. They were the only place I experienced the fun parts of high school, so I ended up developing a highly positive view of them. To this day, I still had a ton of good memories of pep rallies, the songs that were played, the fun activities we watched, and the schools spirit. They really were a high point of high school for me.

Despite that, 99% of my high school experience was still lonely and horrible. One thing I particularly remembered was that 13 Reasons Why came out around the spring of my freshman year. For some reason, that show highly interested me. It probably had to do with the dark and cynical nature the show kind of brought, but I remembered being highly interested in it. Another memory I had was that in one of my science classes during my freshman year, there was a guy in the back of the room I kept glancing at during class. I don't know why, but I just liked quickly glancing and looking at him. Eventually, that guy noticed and started to tell his friends that he thought I was gay. I wasn't, but a lot of people started to hate me for that and viewed me as even weirder, and that is where I started to become paranoid about the tiny things in life. I did start to obsess with all sorts of guys at school, however.

Throughout high school, I literally just locked myself in my room at home watching YouTube and doing homework. It is a sad life, but I can't help it. Everyday when I wait for my parents to pick me up and take me home, I always look around at other students and get sad when I see them talking and socializing with other people. I also remembered getting particularly upset at student-athletes who walked around school for some reason. I always remembered getting particularly angry towards the end of every high school year when I see other kids signing yearbooks with each other and talking while I sat on the side of the classroom glaring in their direction. I was jealous.

I volunteered over the summer between my 9th and 10th grade years. Beginning the sophomore year in high school, I continued to remain a lonely guy. It was also my first year I took AP classes in biology and history, and they took a massive toll on the amount of free time I had. I had extremely bad time management as I would often surf the web while doing homework. It resulted in staying past midnight on multiple days throughout the school year as I started to become stressed out. But I persevered and managed to survive. Around this time, I discovered Reddit. For once, I found a medium to talk to others online and socialize. I began to use Reddit around 2017 and slowly became more active when I fell in love with the site. It eventually became my primary non-school related activity. Inside, I was starting to feel more confident and better about myself and I started to enjoy life a lot more at home. However, this would be my undoing.

Towards the spring of 10th grade I continued to be obsessed about certain guys to the point where I noticed they were on the high school track team, so I started to get the idea of running track. This is where I also remembered when sprinting was one of the better things I did in middle school PE, so I thought I could be good in track. I started to get fed up with being lonely, so I wanted to try something radically different. I told my parents I wanted to do track, but they told me no because my family is horrible at running and they feared I would get injured. I refused to take ""no"" for an answer, so I kept pushing my mom to let me join track to the point of finally letting me see the doctor to get the physical needed to join high school sports. However, the physical came too late so I missed the deadline to join. I ended up never joining that year, and I let the desire to do high school sports fade away.

I volunteered again between my 10th and 11th grade and I continue to do a ton of AP classes and clubs in high school. Again, I spent most of my free time at home being lonely and on the Internet. I continued to remain secluded from everyone else and continued to refuse to go to any school events. I sat at the corner of the library during lunch. However, I still performed reasonably well academically.

I continued to use Reddit around this time and continued to be come more confident online. However, this got the best of me. I got so overconfident towards the end of my junior year in high school that I started to wish I would take advantage of my senior year fully. It was my last year of high school, so I thought I will make it count. This is going to be the start of my decline in life forever. I also started to get dragged into YouTube even more and started to get dragged into a bunch of right-wing politics video. I started to believe them so heavily to the point where it would start affecting my life heavily and I became obsessed with politics, and it took away a lot of emotional stability from me.

I started to get the urge again to do high school running. This time, I wanted to do cross country since it was around the summer and cross country started around the fall. I again started to harass my parents and managed to convince them to allow me to do cross country summer practice. They were extremely reluctant because they feared I would get injured and damage my body permanently. It took a lot of nagging before they finally allowed me to try. I also started to post often on Reddit asking if this was a good decision to start a high school sport in my senior year and asking if it was weird, and people just told me to go for it. So I did go for it. I was by far the slowest runner out of everyone who did summer training, so I thought if I worked harder I would catch up. I also saw on my school's website that tryouts were in August, and the minimum mile time I needed to run was 5:30 minutes per mile to make the team. There were over 50 guys on the XC team, so they didn't have a ton of room for extra people. I thought sports was just like academics where harder work will get you success. However, by the end of July, I started to develop a sharp pain in my right leg. It got so painful to the point where I could no longer run and had to stop training. I never showed up for tryouts because I was injured. I eventually saw a doctor who diagnosed via MRI that I had a stress fracture in both legs and needed to rest for a long time.

I told my parents I was hurt, and they were furious. They were angry because they told be before that I should not run and I would hurt myself, and I didn't listen. I struggled to respect their demands and boundaries. This is where I started to develop massive issues with boundaries and respecting them. I was also told by others online that I needed to start to learn when it is time to give up and the fact that hard work won't lead you everywhere. So, I started to reduce my expectations for the rest of my life and stopped expecting I would end up in some great big career. I would give up trying to have a fun and social senior year.

With my dreams crushed of having the best senior year possible, I started to return to Reddit and started talking about all of my frustrations I had in life in terms of being lonely, the homework and classwork being too hard, and being stressed out. I also talked about how much I failed at running, and I tried to gain running advice because I don't want to see myself as a failure. I want to return to running and hopefully someday be good at it. While I was injured, I kept scouring the internet for advice. When I recovered by early 2020, I tried starting slowly with C25K, and gradually building up there. However, during that time I did suffer minor injuries, but they were minor and it took less than week to heal most of them.

During this time, I continued to be obsessed with Reddit and posted there. Eventually, COVID came along. This forced me to stop running and eventually start running in circles around my backyard. I asked people online if this training was okay, and everyone said yes. So, I followed what I said.

A major downturn at this point of my life is when I started to get blocked from subs on Reddit for breaking the rules. This hurt me massively emotionally as Reddit is the site where I grew up learning social skills, social interactions, and the world in general. I was so sad, angry, and furious. It was also then where I learned harassment was when you keep talking to someone after being told to stop, which was what I did. I was confused by how it was so easy to mess up massively. I was also enjoying watching cop videos on YouTube at the time for some reason, and I eventually came across a YouTube video about a cop tasing an old lady for failing to obey orders. I thought it was cruel at first, but the comments all said the old lady should I have obeyed orders so I thought I was wrong.

This is what lead the incident with my mom. I have been always shut down my people more powerful than me throughout my life, so I wanted to get revenge. That was why when my mom was talking to me one day, I acted like a person in power and told her to stop harassing me or else I will use force against her. My mom didn't stop talking, which met the definition of harassment, so I used force against her. A few moments later, I regretted what I did. I apologized to my mom later, but it is still hard to deal with the fact that I used force against the person who raised and carried me.

My life was spiraling downwards at this point. Around a month later, I would learn this behavior would disqualify me from ever getting a job in a law enforcement because they ask about crimes you were not caught doing in the polygraph. I became shocked, angry, sad, mad, and in despair when I realized I ruined my life so easily. It was harsh to deal with that. I didn't know how to deal with this. When college started, I struggled to pay attention in class or really study at all. Throughout the day, I would spend most of my time on Reddit venting and dealing with the consequences with ruining my life. That is the reason why I struggled to pay attention to math and physics classes. I thought if I couldn't my dream job, what is the point of working hard in school. I continue to be in distress about struggling in college when I realized that not focusing well in my first year would cause problems in my later years because later classes depend on calculus and physics. So, I am getting into a deeper and deeper hole I cannot get out of.

That is how I ended up in my current situation.",3,1,unemployablefailure2
295,npxnw9,2021-06-01 16:13:31,CollegeRant,I registered for a class thinking it would be mostly online but it is not,"Basically, I registered for a lab course as it was listed as “online with some campus meetings” vs other courses which were listed as strictly on campus with set meeting times. Now I am checking the syllabus and all the meetings are in person. The content available online includes online activities, videos, powerpoint slides, handouts, and testing. I can see how this may still fall under how they categorized it but in that case why even have separate categories for the two classes if they were both going to be predominantly in person? I’m just frustrated. I was relying on the flexibility of a course which seemed mostly online which I now don’t have. I’m also mad that the class was presented as not following a typical lab format yet still does exactly that beyond online testing. Part of my preference towards that format is that i’m immunocompromised and in the event I get sick I was hoping I’d be able to more easily keep up with content. Plus, if it had been more clear, I could’ve taken the time to search for courses at a different institution which would have better fit what I was looking for. I also emailed the professor about the in person class schedule beforehand and all he said was that they were still putting together the syllabus and had no set in person dates yet, but I kinda doubt that if they were planning on having them all in person they wouldn’t have known that ahead of time. I realize tho I could’ve put more effort into considering other options so this is honestly a rant on both my annoyance with the college and my annoyance with myself for not being more careful. There’s not much I can do now except hope for the best lol. To anyone else taking summer courses, good luck!  :)",9,1,chunkycorn
296,nnfz5c,2021-05-29 05:00:15,CollegeRant,COVID has made college a nightmare for me,"I am currently incredibly stressed because I live in a 2 bedroom apartment with 6 people, there is no quiet place to study. The only time the house is truly quiet is after 10 PM but that leaves me with very little time to study since I have to get up early for work. This is the only time window I can take online proctored tests because even if I ask everyone to stay quiet and not bother me because I’m taking a test, everyone still makes noise. I wish I could go back to in person classes and campus because I desperately need some quiet time. I can’t study outside because unfortunately my hardest class is one of those math classes where you have to buy the online program to do the hw. If anyone has any advice please help, I’m losing my mind. 

TL;DR: COVID has made it so that I’m stuck in my small, cramped and loud apartment. The noise makes it hard to study.",2,1,jessicaa-iv
297,nlloyl,2021-05-26 16:52:56,CollegeRant,Online Only Experience: Regular VS Community College.,"**It helps that during my experience at CC I was in a better state of mind rather instead of borderline suicidal.**  

TL;DR: Community College was a lot better of a experience compared to a Regular College during COVID. 

Courses:

Regular: 5 Courses beginning &amp; 4 courses ending. (Total: 15-12 credits)

Community:  3 courses beginning &amp; Ending (Total: 13.5 credits) 

In both terms I was taking: The same English Course, A Java Programming Class, and Trigonometry 

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Actual Class experience:

Regular: Majority of the classes didn't host a zoom meeting &amp; when they did it was just the professor blabbering. Majority of the professors I was taught by were Student Teachers. Felt like professors cared more about the pay check instead of the students. My Java programming specifically had practically steps to do things missing, when you tried to ask the professor for instructions again I felt like he was going to yell. 

Community: 3/3 courses were taught by real professors that work at other colleges. Although 1 class I didn't really get ""taught"" by the professor, he answered questions with actual answers instead of riddles. 

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Grading: 

Regular: Grading was usually Cutthroat. had - &amp; + s' (like B- or C+). Had little to none sympathy with students even though it was something that even they haven't experienced. 

Community: Regular grading system. had no - &amp; + s'. 

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Final Grades: 

Regular: A C- and a handful of F's. + a W (withdrawn) 

Community: Unknown. Expecting A-B ratio. (Grades haven't been finalized yet.)

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Workload: 

Regular: Majority of classes accepted late assignments but were heavily deducted points in short times. Assignments majority of the time were due when the class started (I understand it's fair to do that , but I kinda feel that having it due the day of gives the student time to readjust an assignment) . 

Community:  Similar experience to regular (assignments were due day of), late assignments were a lot more merciful. 

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Affordability:

Regular: I think with everything together it was 5,000 USD ish. The only thing I used on campus was the weight room. (I lost those privileges when COVID hit the Midwest) 

Community: It was around 1300 USD overall. I didn't have access to campus (online only + it was closed due to COVID).  I actually don't have to take out another loan if I choose to go to CC next semester. (and if I spend money wisely) 

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Conclusion: It's weird that I'm having a better experience at CC. I kinda thought I was considered ""dumb"" for taking doing it. However, a handful of people in my family actually took classes when they were in college. This feels less like a rant and more like a comparison but I just wanted to share my experience.",4,1,BonkBird652
298,nk48of,2021-05-24 18:07:47,CollegeRant,I couldn’t do it. I ended up failing two of my classes.I feel like a failure .,"I feel upset at my self. I feel like complete garbage. Now this puts me in a situation. 

Per my last post on here. 
I had the opportunity to redo a couple of assignments for two of my classes.the one class I had a 67% and I only needed a 70% . My professor allowed me to re turn in part of a project for a higher grade. 
I’m looking to see if she graded it. I email her to double check , she said that again everything was wrong and it wasn’t right. Which frustrates me that I changed everything and listened to  her comments. 

Now the one class everyone is telling me to appeal. 
My one class my professor waited to the last minute to grade everything. Not only that he gives me a 2/100 out of most of the assignments. Like seriously?! He emails me telling me that I can still redo everything. The problem is 2 things. 
1) this particular class is online based and application class that requires a specific software that has a license through the school. Once that license expires it’s kinda done. I email my professor and literally he doesn’t even read my message. Go to help desk online they fix it. I’m still having issues with it . So now I can’t even redo my work 
2) this professor is my advisor. At first he told me to turn in anything and he’ll pass me. Which I didn’t believe because outside of online classes. I KNOW he is a hard grader. So him even telling me that I did not believe it. Now I did all of my work in a timely manner. Still didn’t grade it. He waited til Saturday to grade everything. And fails me still . This is like 20+ assignments. He didn’t even give me a 50/100 A 2/100 . Then his comments weren’t even helpful . Like this is wrong or this isn’t correct. Obviously I know , like what is the issue 🙄

Not to sound like a conspiracy therorist but I believe he failed me to prove a point that I should’ve dropped the class. I’m set to graduate next spring and I feel like this holds me back. I have to do a lot of work. I’m nervous because I have to graduate next spring. I feel like complete shit. This isn’t me . This semester was the toughest semester for me.",5,1,shygirlsclub
299,njaq36,2021-05-23 16:02:37,CollegeRant,Professor curb stomped my ass,"Well well well, finally a place I can vent about this situation that’s been really lingering in my head space. So it was the fall of 2020 and I am taking an ethics class at an online university to fulfill a pre-req for a program I got into this spring. I am cramming the pre reqs in this past semester and taking a total of 7 classes. I’m taking classes at my home campus in person and another school online. I’m giving these details maybe to justify my scrambling and load management tactics I was engaging in on a daily basis. The semester is going on and I’m crushing all my classes but halfway through this ethics class starts to receive less and less of my focus and I’m just turning in assignments and passing tests with minimal effort and completing them by hitting all the points in the grading rubric to get an A but the effort isn’t heartfelt and maybe the professor notices. Also, I am not spending much time on the readings and I’m sure the professor can see my time logged into her class. This comes to a peak on the final assignment where we have a group project. What happens is there are legit technical difficulties with the website where some student can open the assignment and others can’t. This frustrates the professor with all the emails she gets from the issue (also she’s older and just didn’t understand what went wrong). So my group finishes the assignment before the assignment is due and turns it in. There’s a handful of people in the class this happens to so she begrudgingly makes new smaller groups to do the assignment. From the emails she’s really giving off the vibe that she thinks we are just lazy and faking the technical difficulty. First red flag. As the assignment gets closer to being due no one in my group has worked on it. I forsee a catastrophic incident brewing where I imagine my group mates won’t do their part. The due date approaches and my group has excuses with having to work etc. lucky for me I thought this would happen so I had completed everyones part in anticipation of this with like a good 24 citations total and just a great project complete. I turn it in and get the grade back to my complete and utter disgust. She graded it to deprive me of just enough points to where I would get a 89.9 or B. It pissed me off so much because she wasn’t even subtle. I got 0’s in like three categories including citations and formatting which were done properly. I wanted so badly to report the situation but I knew if they really looked at everything they’d realize I did the whole project and also my logged in times were low throughout the semester etc.. I know I earned an A by the rubric but I also gave generic answers and didn’t give much effort all semester so I accepted my lone B for the semester. I’m still pissed that she would bomb my last assignment like that. Also, post scriptum, group assignments online suck ass. Also , Phoenix is a joke and that one old lady ethics professor is trash.

300,nhwc72,2021-05-21 16:15:15,CollegeRant,Prof. giving me a zero on my final unless I retake the exam with my camera on,"I completed taking the final exam for my Algebra class in which I received unfair treatment from the professor. We were told prior to the exam that we needed to be on logged in on zoom (with camera and mic off) throughout the exam and I made sure to do so. As soon as I completed the exam, I received an email from the professor stating:

""As it was explained and posted on Black Board, you were supposed to be on zoom during the time of final exam. YOU failed to follow the instruction, and your score for Final will be in question for verification of the person who took the test.""

During my entire time on zoom, I did not hear the professor call my name once, although she claims to have called my name multiple times to turn my camera on. She also claims to have sent me chat messages. However, the only time she did message me was when I was done with my exam. I responded to the message the second she sent it.

I did however hear her calling the name “Dina.” Multiple times. I’m not sure if she was saying my name with her accent or not, but I know I would have noticed my name being called. She completely gaslighted me and made me feel insane.

She refuses to accept my grade for the test due to her claims. Instead, she demands that I retake the entire exam a different day with my camera on. I find this completely unfair, as my classmates and I were all taking the exam under the same circumstances, and I'm the only one being asked to completely retake the exam. I asked the professor for her reasoning, and she claimed that I finished the test quickly, which is untrue as the majority of my classmates completed it before I did.

I even described to her the things she said during her time on zoom to prove that I was on and actively listening while taking the test. I also asked her multiple times if she would ask my classmates if they heard her calling my name, to which she completely ignored. 

Instead she made me stay passed the class time to solve three questions from the test on the virtual board with my camera on. I tried to solve them, but my camera was blocked from the system and I couldn’t unblock it. Additionally, there was no pen on the screen to allow me to solve the questions. She made me feel like I was lying, so I asked her if she would like me to email a picture of my screen to prove that I’m not. She refused to allow me to do so. 

Another thing I needed to mention is the way the professor spoke to me. She was yelling at me as if I was her five-year-old child. It was extremely unprofessional and belittling. She had absolutely no understanding of my situation and completely dismissed my point of view. 

I took my exam amongst all the other students in my class with our cameras off, yet I'm the only one being asked to completely retake the test. This is my final exam and I feel like it's only fair that the grade I received for it should be final, the same as everyone else who took the exam with me. I sent an email to the dean in hopes of helping my situation, but I’m afraid they will side with the professor. But we’re taking this semester completely online. The only accusation she has of me cheating is based on suspicion. No one was asked to turn on the camera during the test unless she was suspicious. I find that unfair. Let everyone keep their cameras on during the test instead of using unfair judgement to pick on students.",4,1,Diligent_Noise_4065
301,nhi6r7,2021-05-21 02:43:16,CollegeRant,Should I Stay or Move Out?,"Hello everyone,

I (F19) just finished my first semester at a community college. I plan to earn my associate's degree and then transfer to a 4-year college for my bachelor's degree. I have been taking 100% online classes due to the pandemic and I plan to attend online classes this summer as well. I live in the US.

Here is where the problem comes in: While I can attend most of my gen ed classes online, I need to take science and math classes in person this fall in order to graduate on time and transfer. My parents are not happy about this. Firstly, my college will not require masks or vaccinations and they are concerned about this. Secondly, my parents do not want to drive me to campus 3 days a week. I do not own a car and I do not have a job. My parents do not want me to work and they want me to focus on college. I have agreed to this because I need to maintain a high GPA in order to transfer to a nice college and attend graduate / medical / law school. My grades are my top priority.

Here are the options I have:

1. Move into my community college's student housing (which is fairly far away from home) and walk to campus. I have the financial resources to pay for housing. It is important to note that my college's student housing is well-known for being bug-infested and smelling like smoke. The area also has some crime. The cons here are obvious: No more care of any kind from my family, no support system, money will be wasted on housing and I will not be able to see my pets anymore. I will definitely have to pay extra for a one bedroom because I do not trust any roommates I get to not steal my belongings or make my life miserable.
2. Continue living with my parents while attending online classes and delay transferring to a 4-year college. I should add that my parents are often emotionally abusive and we get into several bad verbal fights each month that make me cry. My parents have some mental issues. I love my parents very much despite the pain they cause me. They do not fully support my choice to attend college and they do not fully understand the importance of higher education. I strongly believe that I have depression, however it has not severely impacted my academic performance so far (I have a 4.0 GPA). I have the benefits of free rent (hopefully this will not change anytime soon), meals and any essentials that I need are paid for. My home is in a middle-class, low-crime neighborhood and I have a quiet study space in my bedroom.

**TL;DR:** Because of the pandemic, my parents do not want me to attend the in person classes that I need to graduate on time. They believe I will get the entire family sick and that I will give into peer pressure and remove my mask in class. Student housing is terrible. My parents are often emotionally abusive. My future success and grades are my top priority. Should I stay or should I move out?

Any advice is welcome. Thank you.",2,1,grumpygerman3544732
302,nhayjm,2021-05-20 20:42:52,CollegeRant,What should I do if I'm not ready or mentally well enough for college?," I am currently on advisor hold in my college because my GPA is under 2.0. I apparently failed two classes that I was completely unaware I as inrolled in. I take full responsibility for this regardless, but I don't know what this means or what to do. I woke up too late in the day to do anything about it now and I just had my biggest panic attack in months. 

Absolutely none of this would've happened if I was able to go in person for college. I was a straight A student all through High School. But this entire year has been my lowest point in education. I am undiagnosed, but pretty much sure I am Autistic, plus I have severe anxiety and chronic depression. I also absolutely DESPISE the class that I got into, and from the first day of it was became completely unmotivated. I've had suicidal thoughts for months, I've missed assignments because I was physically unable to get out of bed, I've misunderstood assignment instructions, and so much more. This entire year has just been one lone depressive episode and I don't have any excuse aside from that. I don't know what to do. I just finished my first year and I'm in my Summer semester.

I don't want to give up. I'd be the first one in my family to go through college, that's why I pushed myself in the first place, but I didn't realize that I honest to god just wasn't ready. I'm in too deep now and I don't know what to do. I'm tired of it all and I'm scared. 

TL;DR : I'm fucked up my entire chance at college because of my mental health and online school and I don't know if I should drop out or not.",8,1,kylaroni

The professor is a great guy but his exams are just so hard, unnecessarily so. I’m not a big fan of his teaching style and always have to rewatch the lectures over again because he goes so fast through the material. It’s very much a teach yourself course which is not a problem except his exams are just insanely hard. 

Normally I’m an A student but I couldn’t get past a B- on his exams. I’m not a great test taker anyways and online does not help. I would watch all his extra material and go to all his office hours and extra review sessions but there is something about his style of exams that just made it so hard. 

I really really want to hate the guy but I can’t even find it in me because the professor is just such a nice person. He held a two and a half hour review session for the cumulative final and had tons of review material. He’s so kind and helpful and really knowledgeable. So here I am, angrily writing a nice rate my professor review and putting in a decent eval of him because anything less would be dishonest. It’s one of those things where I can really only blame myself. I tried as hard as I can and I have to live with the fact that it just wasn’t good enough. I’m praying I managed to get a good enough grade on the final to get a B+ in the class.

304,nfeoni,2021-05-18 16:10:11,CollegeRant,I’m so mad/sad/disappointed,"Ok so spring 2020, the semester we went online I struggled with the switch at first and my grades definitely reflected it. So last semester, I did my absolute best and ended with straight A’s (1 A-) to boost my culmulative. This semester my classes were much tougher, so I didn’t expect straight A’s again but I expected majority A’s and like 2 B’s. Well now we’re coming to the end I have an A an A- 2 B+ and a B. The thing is tho is that one of the B+’s is literally 1.17 away from being an A-. So I nice asked (I did not request, just ask) if she would be rounding final grades for the class this semester and if not that would be completely fine. She completely ignores my email and sends one to the class w like the stats from the final and says “I will not be taking final grade requests”, basically throwing shade at me even tho I never said “change my grade to an A-“ I just asked if she would be rounding for the whole class. But I’ve literally gotten 98%-100% on every single homework and I have B’s on both exams (it was hard to get an A on an exam as each question was worth 13.3 pst so you could only miss like 2) but I’m still 1.17 short of an A-. Anyways, getting a B+ in this class drops my semester gpa to below a 3.5 so now I’m not gna be on the deans list that I worked so hard to try and get on again. And to add salt to the wound it’s gna lower my culmulative gpa by .2.  Now I know to some these may be good grades and they definitely are but the reason I’m so concerned is because I’m planning on applying to grad school in the fall and having a low culmulative isn’t great. I had a 3.41 and now I’ll have a 3.38. I wanna apply to competitive top schools but now I fear that my grades are really gna hold me back.

Literally had some exams done online in the past, and when they finally get graded, never do I have the ability to look back and see what I did wrong nor was I ever told what I failed on. How could I possibly learn from this for possible future career or even the final (if they combine all lessons together) if I never get to see what was wrong? If you want to lock it during the time it's still open and could be leaked to other students to help them cheat, perfectly reasonable. But don't have it locked all this time so I'm unable to know what I understood correctly, especially on exams with fricking WRITTEN RESPONSES.

It is so fucking frustrating working with classmates who didn't do the reading, didn't watch the lecture, and zone out during class. I've had so many instances being paired up with a classmate who just opened up with ""sooo I didn't do xyz required for this assignment \*haha\*, did you?"" or just zone out while the professor was explaining in extreme detail what they require for the assignment, and say ""so what are we supposed to do?"". COME ON.

&amp;#x200B;

I am just so fucking tired.

&amp;#x200B;

My lab partners are the worst. We have asynchronous lectures posted online that are recommended to watch before the in-person labs so you have an idea what is going on. My lab partners NEVER watch the lecture videos. They are completely unprepared and confused. They ask basic questions that would be solved by reading the textbook and watching the lab, causing us to end up behind. I've resorted telling them ""Oh this was explained in the lecture? If your confused go back and rewatch it. We need to move on"". Then they have the balls to say I am refusing to work as a group. They are barley passing the course, and act surprised when I have a 97 in the class.

308,ndspq4,2021-05-16 17:02:57,CollegeRant,Professor is way too paranoid about cheating,"Hello Reddit. I'm making this post because my college professor is way too paranoid about cheating. She mentions not to cheat every lecture and constantly brings up photo math. It's comical how often she brings it up. Her assignments are alot harder than they need to be because of paranoia. If you don't show work the way she taught you and she's not convinced how you got the answer then you're pretty much gonna get the question wrong. In my opinion, running an online class should be a whole lot more lenient especially during covid. I can't wait to finish the semester so I can finally change teachers. This one is just not a good experience at all and makes math not fun. Its got me feeling paranoid like, ""What if she thinks I'm cheating and marks me off?""

Building critical thinking) and I’m doing my classes solo without zoom classes. Before asking, yes I’m still passing all of my classes with B’s.

Ever since high school I always noticed myself having many symptom that ADHD comes with and I have also suffered from anxiety. I’ve always been too scared to get tested for ADHD or to be medicated for it. I noticed throughout my nursing semester that I was having a really hard time focusing, keeping things in, and also my mind wondering during lectures. especially with everything being online now. 

I finally decided to get tested for it and it turns out that I do in fact have it. I was wondering if anyone has had any luck appealing a grade due to just finding out they had a disorder?

311,n9i3gh,2021-05-10 22:34:38,CollegeRant,Potentially Failed my Bio Final,"Last week, in my Intro to Bio course I had a 69%. My professor recalculated everyone's grades so my grade had gotten rounded to a 74%, so no worries there, right?

Negative!!

I just took my Biology Final Exam (150 points total), and I have such a strong feeling I failed it. Half of the things on the exam I had no recollection of the answers. I knew it, but I didn't. It was essentially an accumulation of our past exams and the new chapters we had learned the previous 2-3 weeks. I'm terrified of having to repeat the class, especially since I'm a biology major. I know being an online might have definitely been a part of it, especially since I had to take my exam from 4am to 6:30am (I'm fully remote and I live in a different country from my school (USA) but I plan to travel over the summer). I don't know what to do, all I want to do is scream and cry. I honestly feel so hopeless because I did great my previous semester (had an 89%), but this semester really threw me for a loop. We were able to have a loose-leaf paper ""cheat sheet"" on the exam, but it honestly did not help at all (I wrote it just before the exam, and that's honestly what screwed me over because I did not have time to write all the concepts I wanted to down. After the exam, we have to scan and submit a copy of our cheat sheet, and it's supposedly graded out of 100 points). The lowest potential grade I can get on my final is either a 53% (80/150; if she does not grade the cheat sheet 100%) or a 36% (54/150; if she grades the cheat sheet 100%).

I just wanted to let this out and vent. I just finished my exam an hour ago now. I might take a nap or something to cool myself down from anxiety. Thanks for reading this if you do :)",3,1,professorlychee

Why do I even need to be in a class if everything I need to know can be learned from reading the book?

313,n8hns9,2021-05-09 16:25:03,CollegeRant,I Am Not Afraid to Fail vs What Everyone Expects of Me,"If I keep on trying to make a fancy intro, I will never get to what I want to say. 

So I will just spit it out: I AM **NOT** AFRAID TO FAIL MY CLASS THIS SEMESTER. 

That being said, I am afraid of what *my advisors will think of me, my performance, work ethic, etc.* when I fail this class. I am not even ashamed if I fail this class, because I can retake it (I recognize that being able to say this comes from a place of privilege because not everyone can afford to retake a class and have every implication that comes with it). But I am not afraid, though just a little bit worried. Failing this class may mean taking one more class than usual in the summer, or worst-case scenario, not graduating when I'm supposed to (I'm already estimated to stay an extra semester or two). But I have accepted all these, and I can try again. And if I try again, I will really make sure that I won't fail *again*. 

But how do I explain all of this to my advisors, in the event that my failure becomes official? I know I may sound harsh, I may not be giving them the benefit of the doubt, but I know they expect me to do better. I *KNOW* I can do better, it just happens that being online and isolated has just really taken a toll on me. I could just lay in bed all day and stare at the ceiling, I really don't have it in me to pretend that everything is okay and it's business as usual. Do they all really expect us to function normally? Because I'd rather keep my peace and try again especially when life has proven to us the past year or so that trying to kill yourself to pass a class is not worth it because there are more important things to living than that??  

Maybe at this point, I may have convinced you of my plight. But let me add more context: the class I am talking about is Organic Chemistry 1, I am a Sophomore Student and a Chemical Engineering Major. Let be me circle back to the concern with my advisors: I am afraid of what *my advisors will think of me, my performance, work ethic, etc.* when I fail this class. ***I am afraid how failing this class might inform them of my possible future as a Chemical Engineering student.*** 

Call me crazy. Call me shallow. I may sound like I'm overthinking, overreacting. But it's so hard to focus on the big picture when in the small steps along the way, one obstacle feels like it will strongly dictate the rest of your path, that this small step will either make you or break you. And I feel like, at this moment, some breaking might happen.  

TLDR: I’m not afraid to fail a class LOL but afraid of how failing might look to my advisors especially with my major :(",4,1,No-Description626
314,n76otj,2021-05-07 19:25:40,CollegeRant,"I love online classes and I want more online options later. However, faculty and the more outspoken student body (because of their extraversion) don't which is a bummer.","I am a sophomore at a top-ten business school my majors set up to thrust me into economics and policy as a career. I was in semester two of my freshman year when lockdowns started.

**I LOVED ONLINE CLASSES**. 

* ***They save commute time***. I find them to be so much more efficient than commuting all the way to class in person only to have to relearn everything when I get out of class. I dreaded having to leave my dorm room just to go to lecture. 
* Sometimes, I didn't even go because I didn't see a point unless attendance was part of my grade, but even then I maxed out the number of times I can miss class. Last year before COVID hit, ***I don't think I learned much from attending lectures in person***. I had to learn everything on my own time. 
* Not only that, but the nature of ***online classes convinced most professors to make their exams open book and open note*** which is why I think I did fairly better in some classes than I otherwise would have had COVID not hit. I feel sorry for those who had to take some of the classes I am taking now *in person* where the exams were not open-note. The classes weren't necessarily *difficult* but we had to remember a lot of minor details that can easily be mixed up with other concepts. This open-note policy better reflects how the real world works. Yes, we need to know some basic concepts but I think college should be about skills instead of the content itself. Plus, if you look at your notes or online for help on a concept enough times, you will eventually grasp the concept.
* I am disappointed that no business or economics professor is offering online classes next semester. Even the classes that satisfy the world culture credit requirement are only offering classes that do not interest me. I am DREADING the re-opening of campus. As I said before, I barely learn anything in lectures. On top of that, **my social struggles cause me to feel serious envy when I see others form relationships in person while I just** ***can't*** (2 years in college and I have only made ONE friend who is graduating this year and moving to New York). I don't get why flexible courses aren't an option. It's not that hard to just renew a Canvas course. After all, the content and videos *are already on there*. I even voiced these viewpoints to a professor but he was adamant about keeping all his classes in person because in his experience, students retain information better in that mode of instruction. I suspect I will struggle academically as well as socially next semester.",10,1,redditeconliberty
315,n6qr7e,2021-05-07 04:58:38,CollegeRant,Just really tired - long ass rant please go off in the comments if u want to as well,"Idk if anyone will see this but I think if I find at least one person who relates, I’ll be reassured. I’m so tired of this semester. I’m a first year student who’s gone to campus for 2/ however many days this year has been. My entire first year, completely and utterly online. In the middle we had options to go to campus because even though classes weren’t happening, the libraries and labs and stuff were open. But living with immunocompromised parents, I knew I couldn’t go because no one was following any sops whatsoever. I thought everyone else thought and did the same. I was wrong. Everyone went to campus, made friends. Even if they don’t meet frequently, there are designated friend groups of people who I would have loved to interact with but now feel like there are no ways to do so. I have a few friends, and know some people from a levels but I feel so alone. It’s gotten worse over time. My family doesn’t understand the workload because they all have equally if not more stressful lives. I’m essentially not taken very seriously because I’m the youngest. And at the end of the day I have no one to talk to because I feel guilty for pestering them when undoubtedly they deal with the same university stress that I do. And the workload oh my god the fucking workload. I have had to turn in around 8 assignments in the span of a week. And they’re not easy, short ones. They’re essays and readings that I also got quizzes on. Presentations and bibliographies and more readings. Ive had teachers say how they’re making the finals more difficult because this semester has been online. What the fuck? They’ve increased workload, they’re relentless and even worse than they were first semester. We have no breaks, no extensions. We’re shamed and we’re blamed for not attending class when all of us are so so exhausted and can’t even get out of bed. I know I haven’t. It’s been so bad. And then my professors have the god damn nerve, the fucking audacity, to say that we (the students) make it about grades when it’s so much more than that. It’s about “learning” and “building our critical thinking skill”. Fuck. Off. You can’t say that and then give us back to back work one week away from finals week. And then expect that any of us are processing any information at all. And the worst part is, during all of this, I feel like I’m the only one struggling. And I know, i KNOW that isn’t true but it just feels and seems that way. No matter how early I try to start and how efficient I try to be, nothing ever fucking works out. I feel so dumb and so stupid all the time. I’ve stopped being able to form sentences and words that make sense! My brain has been in a fog that’s only been worsened because of this semester especially. And my anxiety has reached a point where there’s never a moment that I’m not having palpitations or tinnitus symptoms (google told me I have a disease only 15-20% of the population had which made the beating WORSE and then I figured out it was just anxiety). I sleep to little. I sleep too much. I get shamed for both. I eat too much. I eat nothing at all. It’s Ramadan and it’s the first time in my entire life where I haven’t enjoyed it or enjoyed fasting. I’m running on three hours of sleep to just get everything completed but nothing seems to finish and if it does, five other things are assigned. Being a social science kid, those things are lengthy and require at least reading the text five times for me to even understand wtf this random white ass philosopher dude means. I never figure it out. My professors are taking vivas. My fucking MATH PROFESSOR??? Is taking a VIVA??? Honestly the next thing I know my professors will be coming over to personally quiz and test and pester me about my memory retention and then lecture me about how the only thing I care about are grades. And honestly yeah I do. Because those are, no matter what anyone says, the only things that matter. As of now. Maybe that will change. What’s permanent though is that I’m tired, exhausted, anxious, apathetic for someone who absorbs other peoples emotions I don’t even know what to do with people anymore, frustrated, irritated, and all that jazz.

316,n60fpn,2021-05-06 05:56:14,CollegeRant,Grades are not an accurate reflection of ability,"I'm taking 3 core courses required for my major. 2 of them are taught by the same brilliant professor who is everything you could ask for from a professor. He responds to emails (even ones sent at stupid hours), he is competent at teaching, his lectures are relevant and extremely well presented.  His labs, homework and quizzes are tough but fair. His exams are extremely cutthroat and as a result, my grade in there is extremely poor (the average for exams is a mid to high C). 

On the contrary, the other course is taught by a garbage, incompetent, lazy professor who skipped class for about 3 weeks with bs excuses, copy and pastes exact questions from the homework WORD FOR WORD (the average on one of the 3 exams was a 19/20), and hands out points like they are candy on Halloween. I took the final recently for that course and it was at LEAST 90-95% copy-pasted from the midterm/homework. It was online so it was open notes. Obviously I didn't study because I knew he was lazy going in so why should I put in any effort towards a course he doesn't out any effort into testing us. Should I do well on that (I am estimating at least a 90, but probably higher) and the final project, I will have a significantly higher grade in that course than the aforementioned courses with the competent teacher. 

I feel like I learned sooooooo much relevant and very good material from the competent professor from those two classes and absolutely nothing from the incompetent teachers course. Unfortunately, the grade for the courses might suggest the opposite as I did relatively poorly in the competent teachers courses (see extremely cutthroat exams), but well in the incompetent teachers courses. 

Its such bs that the grades don't reflect actual learning done from courses but rather how much you can memorize or how well you can do ctrl + F and it makes me mad. 

Tldr: getting poor grades in courses you learned a lot in and getting good grades in courses you learned nothing in is utter garbage and not an accurate reflection of one's ability.",3,1,wherearetheturtlles

319,n4y4om,2021-05-04 21:00:28,CollegeRant,Panicking for my last final,"So basically I changed my major halfway through this last semester, but I was already enrolled in a statistics course that I no longer need for my major. It was synchronous but I treated it like an asynchronous course since it no longer mattered what I got in the course since it was now an elective, and my school allows for one elective to be P/F during a semester. After deciding this, my school went with P/F grading, and I could just Pass any class and it would still count towards my major. Regardless, I still worked hard in the course, but usually put my other classes first. 

The first exam is where I went wrong. It was worth 20% of my grade and I completely bombed it, scoring a 40% where the average was a 70%. Somehow, I still had a C in the course, meaning I was going to be okay just as long as I didn't fail it. I worked hard for the next exam and scored a 90%. The problem was, I actually scored under the mean. The mean dramatically went up to a 93% and the high was a 120%. This meant that my final grade went up only 3%, and I was still at a C. 

With the final coming up, I calculated that I needed at least a 60% to get a 70% overall in the class, so I get a C and am able to P it. The final is worth 35% of my grade. The finals allow for 3 large cheat sheets and have extra credit problems. Even though it doesn't even matter if I need to accept a Fail in the class, Since it won't count towards my GPA, I don't necessarily want a Fail on my transcript. My grades were so dramatically distributed that it's hard to tell what I will get on this final. 

I'm also just a little embarrassed becuase the class has such a high GPA. Looking at previous semesters grade distribution, 32% of kids get A's, while only 10% get C's. I really struggled with the class being online, and having changed my major halfway through the semester. The professor and TA were also no help to me in discussion sections and office hours. The professor would also take really confusing notes and it was hard to follow. I am having a hard time getting over how poorly I performed in this class. I'm usually an average to high performing student, so this semester was just a big shock to me. 

I'm just praying to God that I get a C in the course like every other course I had this semester. It's really disheartening how badly I performed but I attribute a lot of it to covid ruining how things operate at my school.",4,1,Ecstatic-Brush-3787

This is my first time posting on Reddit, but I just wanna get this off my chest and also wanna know if I’m the only one who does this. Ever since the pandemic happened and online classes started, my motivation to study is just non-existent. I’d feel lazy to focus in class, so I’ll just attend the online class sessions and wander off doing other stuff like watching tiktoks or something unproductive haha. So let’s say during the 12 weeks of studies, I wouldn’t focus at all. So I had no idea what the hell everyone’s learning in class. I wouldn’t participate in the tutorials or even self study. But I’d work my ass off for my assignments/coursework and would score high marks for them. Two or three weeks before finals, I’d stay up all night and wake up super early to watch recordings and study the whole syllabus myself. Basically cramming everything last minute for my exams. Then, I’d end up getting high distinctions which is like 80% and above. So to all of the college students here, I just wanna know if I’m the only one who does this?

325,n1ntzr,2021-04-30 06:18:39,CollegeRant,My professor holds bi weekly exams on the weekends from 6-8 pm and because of this I am about to go broke and get fired.,"I am a junior [F20] majoring in computer science. All my classes are online. For all my classes, my professors usually give us a week or so to finish an assignment and submit it by 11:59 pm on Sunday. However, for one of my classes, except for homework, my professor, holds online quizzes and exams either on Saturday or Sunday from 6-8 pm. 

For that particular class we have bi weekly quizzes, 1 midterm, 1 final and 4 practical (coding) exams. All of these are due either on Saturday or Sunday from 6-8 pm which means we have to start the exam no later than 6:15 pm and submit it by 8 pm. The problem is, me and many of my classmates have jobs on the weekends (usually evening shift). Since, this was asynchronous class and since we did not have a fixed class time, literally everyone had problem with the deadline on weekends. We bugged our professor about a million times regarding this issue, but he gave no fucks. Since, he was the department head, we could not do anything but report it to the Dean. The Dean did not care either. I tried to switch professors at the beginning of the semester, but since my professor was incharge, the deadline was same for all other professors as well. 

In order to pay for my classes, I work at a retail store on the weekends. I have a fixed schedule of 2-11 pm. Since I have other classes on the weekdays, I can’t work on weekdays either. I did mention about my assignments deadline to my manager at the beginning of the semester and he was very understanding. He would modify the schedule as requested.  Everything was fine for couple of weeks.  However, my old manager died of heart attack and we got a new manager. The new manager was also understanding and helped me for few weeks. However, because of Covid, we are so short staffed, that my store literally does not have anyone else to cover my shift. Because of this, I had to either go late to work or call off the entire day. I can’t take leave/days off every other week as well. It costs me around $60-$100 per shift. So far, this class has cost me $1200. Now I have no $$ left to pay for my summer class. We are almost at the end of the semester and only have few quizzes, 1 practical exam and final left. However, I only have 1 more call out point left at work, before I get fired. Don’t know how I will manage it.",10,1,Illustrious_Sector19
326,n0lkf6,2021-04-28 18:36:36,CollegeRant,Why are professors allowed to be so bad at their jobs?,"I am in the last class required for my major and have a 3.8 GPA in my major to date. This class has caused me so much stress that my hair is falling out. Here's a rundown of how the class works:

Online lectures where the professor projects his typed notes onto the screen and reads off of them nearly word for word. These notes are essentially just the book paraphrased. There is also one midterm and one final exam that make up most of our grade. 

The midterm was rough. I failed and upon reaching out to my classmates, realized that everyone who I spoke with failed with the exception of one who got 1% above failing. The professor refused to tell us the average on the exam and refused to curve. I asked for clarification on his grading on one specific question and he pretty much told me everything was technically correct, but I had forgotten to check one of eight things so I got nearly 3/4ths of the points taken off. On top of being a hard grader, he gives us the hardest problems from the book for our homework. My tutor is even unable to help me with some of the problems and he has a graduate degree in the subject. The professor also does not have office hours, instead he asks that we send him emails to ask questions. The catch is he doesn't respond to every email. Even when he does help, half of his answers are just stating that something is easy so we should do that part on our own. The class has shrunk greatly in size from the start of the semester due to people withdrawing. 

I have reached out to my dean to raise my concerns about the professor. They said they will speak with him and get back me, but I don't feel like they will do anything.",72,1,GreenEqualiTea
327,mzl9gk,2021-04-27 10:17:50,CollegeRant,I'm lacking motivation and care in college. I've failed all of my exams this semester. I'm about to get a failing grade in 2 of my classes this semester as well. Can't afford for college anymore.,"This has never happened to me before. I was in an okay position my first two years, but this year it got way worse for me. I had a hard time paying attention to all of my classes this entire year, especially this semester. 

I had to drop one course last semester and I'm failing the same course again this semester. I'm failing another course as well, because I didn't do any work in that class at all. I had no clue how to do the work at all, I had no motivation either. I will end up losing more college credits and fall behind, I can't afford for extra classes in the future.

My mom and sister will be very angry at me for not doing well in college this year. My GPA will go down and my out-of-state tuition scholarship will be gone. My sister pays parts of my tuition, so there's that. I can't afford for college anymore. I will end up making them both disappointed/angry. I've literally gone to college because of them forcing me to go there, not because I wanted to.

I hated doing online classes. My attention span towards them has been awful. It always ends up being somewhere else, not right in front of my classes.

My Internet connection has been very slow due to my high mobile data speed being limited at 2GB per month (meaning it will throttle afterwards), until my exams kicked in. My laptop got broken the day before exams, I had to use my sister's iPad to finish up my exams.

I wanted to take a gap year because of that, but my mom and sister didn't listen to me. I had no major at that time until I ended up declaring it. The major I'm in pretty much sucks, I'm learning nothing from it, I can't do anything with it.

The worst part is that I have nobody to talk to 1-on-1 about this. I haven't made any friends at college whatsoever, but then again I didn't have any friends during K-12 at all.

I'm screwed anyways, there's nothing I can do anymore. Will lose my out-of-state scholarship, lose  my phone/laptop/Internet, and nobody will accept me in a job environment because I don't have an impressive resume at all.",3,1,-Sky_Nova_20-
328,mz6nqo,2021-04-26 20:06:27,CollegeRant,Well this sucks,"My college has decided to do mostly online classes until the end of the year. The classes that are exempt are classes that need to be in person i.e. welding, machining, auto, construction, etc. 

This is extremely hard for me to pass certain classes. The harder the class the more it sucks for me. I am the type of student that needs in person instruction or constant zoom contact. 

I started taking a Solid Works sheet metal class 4-5 weeks ago. They only offer it in spring and as a short term class. Super fast paced class. We average 4-5 assignments a week. These assignments take me 1-2 hours with a teachers help. Otherwise I find them too hard to complete.

Here comes the big problem for me. I asked to zoom 4-5 times a week with my teacher. He works a 9-5 job and teaches two classes at Fresno city college. So, as you’d expect possibly, our schedules don’t work. I’m usually free in the afternoon between 2pm-5pm because I work lunch and dinner hours. After work is over I’m relaxing so I don’t burn myself out.

I was trying really really hard in the class and couldn’t figure out some of my homework. I tried to zoom my teacher but then it became evident to me I wasn’t going to pass unless I had a personal tutor or something everyday. I don’t have that kind of money. 

I had a chat with my parents about this class and how I felt about it. They advised me to try to drop the class and take a W. I tried but by the time I decided the class wasn’t going to work I could no longer drop the class. We were already half way through the class at this point. Drop policy says you can drop before the half point. I am just taking a failing grade, of which I haven’t had in a few years. 

At first I felt like a failure, but upon thinking about it I decided that it’s not my fault. I worked every afternoon on my assignments and still didn’t have enough time to figure it out. 

Don’t be too hard on yourself if you are trying hard and still failing. I’ve had about three classes total in college where this was the case. At that point my mental / physical health became more important. Hope you guys are doing well! My other class is awesome and I am doing well in it!",2,1,ZachTF

Never cheated, was in the top 20 of my class, studied for hours every day, and did really well in AP classes. Got straight A’s, didn’t want anything below a B, etc. I’m a sophomore in college now and I feel so much worse. Online classes have destroyed my work ethic. I’m happy just to pass my classes, and I have no motivation to study when all exams are open note (and realistically, open internet if there’s no supervision). I’m an engineering student (though I’m changing my major next year) and I feel so stupid compared to my peers and the standard we’re held to. I feel like a complete failure, and I don’t know where this went wrong. 17 year old me would be so appalled by 20 year old me. Anyone feel the same??

331,mxw1kl,2021-04-24 23:45:39,CollegeRant,This semester has made me really bitter and idk how to cope,"
So I'm nearly 30. I've worked in a variety of fields including customer service and construction. I started transitioning (genders) 5 years ago and have experienced a lot of discrimination, both soft and hard. From being called slurs from journeymen or customers, to enduring layoff after layoff even when my technical ability and scores were rated high. Generally, I’ve had a positive attitude, but that has really shifted in the last 2 years. 

I went back to school, I've always passively entertained the notion of going into medicine. I didn't ""believe"" I could until I did things like dismantle wires 30 ft in the air or CAD-weld the perimeter by myself. After the outright hostility I've experienced from my construction coworkers, I decided to look to other forms of employment where my rights could be guarded, too. I did not love construction, I always made great grades. Little by little, per what I could afford, I worked and went to school, part-time and got my AA psych degree with a 4.0. I've since been in a number of leadership positions pertaining to LGBTQ rights and healthcare. 

Oh, and since my parents aren't approving of my transition, I don't exactly have their backup, or a place to stay if it all falls through. 

The profs I signed up for, nearly all of them, have abysmal ratings. Because I was shoehorned in to the university last minute (I needed to complete a transfer orientation which pushed me up). I tried to clear away some ""gateway courses"" so that I may meet BASIC reqs for my new major. I have maybe two years after this, but I'm stuck in limbo intro courses.

There’s the issue of my math class. The software marks you wrong, pretty much each time. The average for these assignments are 60%s, mostly from transcription errors. 1/4th of the class dropped and 1/2 is failing. the other quarter are people like me, with skin-of-the-teeth ""C minuses"" and if my grades drop below a C minus, I don't get this requirement. 

In a lab class, I spent 10 hours inputing (no exaggeration, in fact, it ran from noon until midnight and I had to keep doing the post-lab questions until 5p the next day) 2,000 species of bugs into a spreadsheet. I meant to copy and paste but when you copy and pasted, it duffed the prefab equation in the sheet, and I couldn't replicate that equation. I told the lab prof my situation, and I also had two mid-terms back-to-back the next day, calmly telling him about the spreadsheet situation and how I had budgeted time away to study for my mid-terms. He refused, saying ""I need a better excuse than a busy semester"". Just so you know, this isn't grad school or anything, these are just prereqs for my prereqs.

I cannot tell you how much a 24 hour extension would have meant to me at that time. I could have reconsolidated my notes for my mid-terms. I'm pretty sure I bombed them both and have to make negotiations about my grades with those profs now. What can you say when that's your situation? Should I be ruder about this? 

 I'm also 3,000 in debt... from this semester alone. One more semester of ""LEPs"" before I can start on my degree... yay! 

On top of it all, I've had spotty internet connection. I've done what I could. I live in a square of concrete for 800 bucks/month. My Zoom will outright conk-out mid-lecture, and half my profs don't record their lectures. When I asked if they could due to my situation, I'd get answers with summed-up messages like, ""sorry, EVERYONE is having a tough time right now,"" or ""Sorry, I was a hardass even before COVID"" ... My orgo class was completely online/real time/software based, both book-wise, practice-problem wise, and lecture wise. 60% of it was spent trying to reconnect. I cannot express to you how frustrating this experience was. 

 From the stress, I've gotten sick with fevers three times. Once was real bad bronchitis, and it fucking sucked, having to push through all that while really sick. Bronchitis lasts forever. I quit smoking 3 years ago and thanks to this semester, I'm a regular smoker again. I drink black coffee and black tea just to keep myself humming to 3 am when a lab/essay/set of math practice probs demand my attention. 

I legit don't think grad or med school will even want me. I'm trying NOT to internalize this experience or the experience of the last four years. It would tell me that I'm not cut out for anything, that I've been weeded out several times, and I should REALLY take a hint. 

I've had people tell me, ""have you set artifical deadlines? Maybe a time-management webinar? Are you in therapy?"" The answer is actually yes to all of those, but at some point, I really don't think its ""on me"". When I want 24 hours to look over my notes, or some recorded lectures due to access problems... I really don't feel like I'm asking for much. I'm not rude to my profs. I don't bicker back. And in almost every situation I've been in, be it employment, or the other colleges I've been to, have eagerly worked with me and given me the 5% of wiggle room I needed to thrive. 

tldr I have (two) profs (math/orgo) with students making 40/50%s averages and outright refusing to curve. I have profs who refuse to adjust their completely online teaching style even when their students are walled off from access. I have an error-laden lab class that draws labs out 5x longer than they should, and monopolizes my entire time that I have to study and work to improve my grades. I’m borderline failing in my classes I have profs who write me off when I ask for help. I'm 20 lbs heavier, thousands poorer, back on cigs, and I'm just so damn tired.",20,1,mispIacedintime

All of my exams I had to cram and pray for somewhat good or a massive curve after the fact. I don’t know how I will do in finishing this semester grade wise but it feels like a wasted semester.

Did research and took a class the summer after freshman year, wasn't focused on an internship. Applied to 40+ places sophomore year, no luck so had to do a small project at my dad's company and did virtual research with a prof. Since September 2020, I've applied to 70+ companies (most of which are tiny, recently founded, less competitive trading/insurance firms) and received interviews at TWO of them. Didn't advance in either beyond the second round. 

At this point, the vast majority of my college peers and friends at other institutions have received at least one offer, many from MBB or FAANG. I'm about to take my last final exam. 

96%+ of students at my college participate in at least one internship. If you discount the kids who got an internship at their parents'/relatives' firm, it might be 75-85%. However, you have to account for kids who INTENTIONALLY only do research and/or don't apply for internships at all, which is not at all negligible. 

I CANNOT fucking do online research/classes and stay home for another 4 months -- I've been stuck at home since March 2020. Not to mention, it's going to be EXPONENTIALLY harder for me to land a well-paying job at a decent company after graduating compared to my peers and friends.

You would expect world class education, right? Well no, too fucking bad, because that's certainly not the case here. While we do have a very dense curriculum, that doesn't compensate the downside of poorly prepared and genuinely unqualified profs. 

Roughly half of the lectures are flowing over with misinformation, shitty explanations and useless anecdotes. No joke. It's common that profs present slides with nonsensical bullet points, don't even cover them orally in a way that makes you understand them, and contradict themselves on literally the next fucking slide. When you look the information up afterwards you end up realizing that what they mumbled was complete bullshit - it's FACTUALLY wrong! Like, come on, how can you get something as standardized as a mathematical formula wrong or copypaste a definition from the book you're basing your lecture on with completely different characteristics? That's single digit IQ tier right there. Alternatively: present two or three different formulas (that lead to different results) for one and the same thing and let the students gamble on which one to use. 

And the best part: Only few of them respond properly when you ask them out about it. Even in the rare event of live question rounds, they usually end up ""elaborating"" in vague terms, leaving the questions just as unanswered as they were before. So basically half of the profs of a renowned uni don't even know what they're talking about. 

I seriously spend more time looking all that shit up online and learning from other unis' lectures on YT than watching mine. This is so god damn tiring and even more annoying.

I should’ve dropped it the first week. 

The professor I have, for lack of a better word, is a douche. 

But first a little background. 

I actually took a class with this guy last spring and I was the only English major. I was probably his least favorite student. He was strict, and one time he embarrassed me in front of the whole class, but then the pandemic happened and we went online and he was strict, but he got to be pretty more lenient. 

I figured this time would be different. Most professors who are online know we don’t want this so they have stayed lenient. 

Boy was I wrong! 

I think it’s easier just to list what’s happened this semester rather than describe it:
- you already know about the English major comment. 
- he did discussion boards and wanted us to post once a day for four days straight and reply once a day. He’s probably the only professor I have that does that. My other professors, so long as you post once by a certain day and then reply twice, you’re fine. 
- I didn’t know that because he’s the only professor who does that and my grade kept suffering. He didn’t tell me until halfway through the semester since I would always post on the last day. 
- he almost reported me for plagiarism because I made a typo with citing a quote on the discussion board and he rigged it so you couldn’t go back and change it. 
- he wouldn’t give a girl with a concussion an extension on her midterm because he gave us two extra weeks (ie he delayed it) and “he doesn’t accept late work.” Even though her doctor told her she wasn’t allowed to look at a screen or she’d make it worse. Idk what grade she got but if I was her, I would’ve reported him. 
- he’s making us do a 9AM zoom call next week. If we can’t attend or choose not to (and to him, being unable to is the same as choosing not to), we have to send him a 3 page paper with one critical source about a passage we read.

Modules not opened on time or not accessible at all. The grade book is a mess. Vital information missing from assignments (if they are even unlocked). And exams that have sorta just shown up without any due date prior. 

I am able to access tutoring through canvas. And find an abundance of online information if I have questions on the assignments. A professor has such a small task list for asynchronous classes. Take the time to figure out how to use the software so that you have an easier time. And your students do as well. A lot of your students in these online courses work full time and would like to know due dates and exam dates from the get-go.

I have less than zero interest in doing most of my work. I'm currently in my last semester, literally the only driving force is cause of I don't graduate, I'd be fucked beyond belief. I'm taking two classes where I'm actually doing projects I have interest in, but even then, I have so little energy to give, and I have to give most of it to my three other classes I could give a fuck about. Im taking two classes for a minor I didn't even want, it was required. So I'm sitting here, not actually reading about marketing, and getting up and doing anything besides work because who cares, I'll just get a C.

I'm a good student, or at least was. Held between a 3.4 and a 3.8 all 7 semesters. But I just can't be bothered to spend time on these assignments I know I'm not getting anything out of. Normally class discussion is where I learn, not reading the textbook. It takes me twice as long to read my textbooks now too, since any interest I did have is lost in my constantly meandering mind that just wants a fucking human being to talk to about it.

And the professors don't care or understand, at least like half of them, maybe more based on what my friends have told me. They're relaxing grading criteria, but that's a HORRIBLE way to ""learn remotely"". I haven't learnt jack shit, and anything I have learned is not related to anything the professor has done. They send out an email a week and make assignments. And then when you do have a question, it takes 36 hours to get back to you. And then they complain that no one is coming to them for help, and it's like, IT DOESN'T HELP CAUSE YOU DONT ANSWER OR TEACH ANYTHING. 

So yeah... Kinda pissed lol. I mean I am a lazy person to an extent, but I have just thrown in the towel now, and I can't believe that I paid for this pathetic substitute for ""education"". My tuition should be cut in half based on what I've gotten out of this.

I hope moving forward things continue to go back to normal, and I hope that ""remote learning"" does not become a norm, at least not in a situation where it is the only option. Maybe some people learn better like this, just not.me, and not multiple people I've talked to.

Since I started back at school during COVID, I have no school/life separation. I never get to leave my house. My bedroom is where I sleep and work, since I have nowhere else to go. From the moment I wake up to the moment I fall asleep, there's always more to be done.

Pre-COVID, I was failing online classes because I could never get the separation of meeting in person, doing the work, and having any semblance of existence outside trying to keep up with the class on my own. Now it's just magnified. My dad constantly expects me to do everything around the house when my homework reading and classes take up more hours than his actual, out of the house job.

I haven't slept properly in weeks because I have nothing to separate me from this little room I'm trapped in.

346,mr80xn,2021-04-15 05:05:31,CollegeRant,"Needed to log onto blackboard 10 times a week or I fail the class. So I guess I'm failing every class, despite doing the work.","So basically, I don't know why, but it seems like my professors/entire university are going out of their way to make things harder for students. I normally am not a fan of the sort of ""students are always victims"" mentality because lets face it, this is hard work. No one said this was supposed to be easy. But they didn't say it was going to be a never-ending hellish nightmare. 

At the start of the semester, I noticed my professors all had these lines in their syllabi about how if we didn't log on to blackboard, we would fail the class. The wording wasn't the best, and so I figured maybe they meant like, not logging on EVER, to which I was kind of like ""uh, yeah, duh"". I saw some numbers listed, like 180 total log-ins needing to be tracked, and needing to log on four/ten times a week, and I kind of brushed it off, figuring I'd make those numbers once the semester started up. I had never considered how many times a week I go on blackboard, I just assumed it must be a high-ish number.

Well, I'm about 4 weeks away from the end and I just now realized that I have not at all reached those numbers. In fact, I've logged onto blackboard ONCE a week for most of my classes. I typically go on, write down all my assignments and when they're do, and then I don't log back in until I have to submit them! Because why the fuck would I? I'm DOING the work, right? 

I checked the syllabus again and saw this for one of my classes: 

""I expect you connect to the class platform (Blackboard) at least four times/week. If you ignore the class, you may fail this course. If you don’t connect to the class for more than 10 days, you will fail the course automatically. To provide a fair grading system, I will use online activity monitoring tools."" 

and then again in a different class: 

""Connect to the class platform (Blackboard) at least ten times/week. By the end of the
semester, your course report needs to show that you at least connected to the course for 160
hits.""

Ten times a week....? Are people just living in front of their computers? I had to move back home due to covid and I have to take care of my parents and put up with them. That takes time. I STILL manage to get all my work done and have generally good grades...  but there's no way on EARTH that I've ""connected to blackboard 10 times a week"". Absolutely no way. I've done every single assignment and turned everything in on time. I've gone to every zoom class. But not this. And the thing is, they can and are failing people for it from what I've heard. 

I'm a senior. I have one more semester in the fall. and I absolutely hate this school. I am thinking about school nearly constantly, or I'm just not thinking at all. I just have these moments where I feel brain dead. The rest of the time I'm worrying about an assignment. I don't relax on the weekends, I work. I don't relax at night, I work. I can't sleep, and I mean I REALLY can't sleep. I sleep 2 hours, work, or stare at my work, 2 more, work, and then it's time for zoom class. I am not exaggerating, I genuinely don't know how I haven't had worth health issues because of this. I started getting hives, migraines, and numbness and hypotension, I can't concentrate but I HAVE to concentrate, I am angry all the time, but I'm still able to do work, so I must. I don't have time to properly shower, I don't have time to brush my hair, I just have to constantly be at my computer working on assignments, and even then somehow I didn't manage to log onto blackboard ten times a week.

I just need my undergrad and to get the fuck out because this college has taken my mental health, my physical health, and my fucking will to live from me. The only thing I have left is the ability to say ""I have good grades"" and ""I made deans list"" which guess what-- no one gives a fuck about that shit outside college. No one. So that's all this has given me. And if they want to fail me for not connecting to blackboard then I guess they can. I guess I kind of thought I'd hit those numbers, and clearly I misjudged how I was going to handle the work. I got it all done, but no, I didn't follow their arbitrary rule about blackboard, so now I""m going to fail. And at this point I don't think I could survive a repeat of this semester. If I fail, that's it, I don't want to live. 

It probably sounds overdramatic to some of you but I honestly don't give a fuck. I'm just tired of professors acting like they need to make things harder because things are remote, and I'm tired of putting in so much effort to do my best work only to be penalized for something like this.  

I guess I should probably email my professors and ask if they're going to fail me, but none of them really read emails anyway. 

**TLDR**

My professors are tracking how many times we log onto blackboard. We are supposed to log on 10 times a week for one class, 5 for another, and 4 for another, and the other two just talk about if we don't log on for ten days. I'm taking 5 classes. I figured I'd reach those numbers but I'm realizing now that I really don't think I have. 

Anyway normally I'd ask for advice but I figure most of you will just say I'm being overdramatic or that I should have just made a point to log onto blackboard more, but like, I've never fucking COUNTED how many times I've logged on in previous semesters, so I assumed I probably reached those numbers. Ten times a week seemed reasonable until I got caught up in the semester and realized I haven't been. 

I guess I'm curious if anyone is in the same boat here and how you dealt/are dealing with it",5,1,EudoraHenry
347,mr6gse,2021-04-15 03:16:10,CollegeRant,"Been out of college for nearly a year, my final thoughts","It's been nearly a year since I graduated, and thank God college is now just a distant memory. After all this time, I've been able to collect my thoughts and list why my college experience was atrocious. First of all, one of the biggest problems I had with college was the gen eds. They were nothing but a worthless waste of time, effort, money and sanity. With all the money you're paying, the classes should stick to your major and your major only. People say it's different than high school, but it really isn't. In fact, you could argue that high school was better in some ways: you spent the last ~12 years getting to know your class mates, it wasn't a 30 mile drive every day, and you weren't sitting around in the library rotting for 3 hours waiting for your next class. High school also had a more lax vibe to it. In my college, it felt like the faculty and some students were trying to brainwash you with social justice nonsense, and even going as far as making you take classes on it. It's like, I just want to study my major, pass the exams and get out, I don't need any of this other phoney bullshit.

As far as covid is concerned, here's my thoughts: a lot of students here say it's making college more stressful for them, but it did the exact opposite for me. The outbreak started about 3 months before I graduated, at which point I was nearing my breaking point, just from all the stress. I was taking 6 classes, which is 2 more than usual (they were both gen eds, cause you know, priorities, right?) anyways, I had this, PLUS a substantial senior project working on  throughout the year. I picked those gen eds I mentioned earlier because I would be able to only need to drive to school 2 days a week, which at the time sounded Infinitely better than having to go to drive to that god awful place 5 times a week. Turns out this was not necessarily the case, as I'd have to linger in the library for 12ish hours, with many, lengthy gaps in between. I had several nights where I didn't get any sleep (not one or two hours, zero). By the time I drove home at the end of the day, I had been awake for nearly 30 hours, and was legitimately concerned about being able to drive home safely. This being a regular occurrence, combined with having to man handle several papers at a time from those writing intensive gen eds, had me on my knees. Seriously, I had never been more miserable in all my life.

Then covid comes around. I hear the news that spring break is being extended by a week (as well as the due dates to various assignments, and some actually being cancelled) and classes will be online for the rest of the year. In general, the work load was lightened tremendously as my professors were still trying to figure things out. It honestly felt like Divine intervention, it couldn't have happened at a better time. Everyone else was bummed out they couldn't have in person learning, not me. I had no connection whatsoever with my school, barely knew any body. Just sat through the lectures and went home. What else could I do? At least when it's online it makes it that much more tolerable. I guess since this is a new school year and each college has different covid policies, I can see how some may not like how their school is handling it. But for me, I had no problem with it. I didn't even care about having a graduation ceremony at that point, I just wanted to get out. When I finally graduated, I felt like Andy Dufresne when he broke out of Shawshank. Free at last.

When people say ""oh you went to college u must've got laid and partied every day"", I don't even know how to respond, a part of me even dies when it happens. Kinda just wish I could erase this part of my life from my memory.",5,1,onslaugh1552
348,mr4d40,2021-04-15 01:05:30,CollegeRant,Universities suck fat nuts at grief support (at least mine didn't respond well to my issues),"My niece and her mom died in an accident. I was very close to her and am devastated.

I emailed my professors each to let them know what happened. One was very sweet and told me that any homework due will be extended and to contact him and he'll meet up outside of office hours to help me through any missed material. My other 3 professors basically said ""Sorry for your loss. Try to keep up with the material."" Another one said ""feel free to watch the lecture through Zoom today"". Like... all of those responses felt so cold. I'm not expecting them to hug me or anything, but like... I dunno.

The day I found out I ran over to comfort my brother who just lost his niece and the mother of his child (they both died the same way at the same time). I missed all of my classes because I was a crying mess. I checked later and a professor who does daily worksheets for attendance gave me a 0 for the day because I was not in class.

I am not handling this well. I'm not sleeping well, I'm traveling in and out of town to help with my brother. Each time I try to sit down and study, I either don't retain the information or I'm going at such a snail's pace that I'm not getting all of my work done and turning in incomplete assignments (sometimes both). I looked online and saw the school does group counseling for students, as well as one on one sessions). I called the university counseling center to get information. I explained the situation to the person over the phone. No ""sorry for your loss"" or ""let's find you resources that you need"". Instead, I got a ""well I know they do a group grief session, but they just ended that and they won't be doing that in the Summer."" and ""it's too late in the semester to start more counseling and they won't be doing that in the summer either"" they had an emergency counselor but she said that they're ending those soon too. She just felt so... cold about it. My fucking 7 year old niece died, one of the shiniest people I knew, and any communication from the university has just been piss fucking poor.

I can't take an incomplete, because right after my finals I have my wedding, and then 2 days after my wedding day I have my Summer internship. On top of that I'm trying to make sure my brother gets the help he needs and doesn't drink himself to death. My fiance needs help with the wedding since it's so soon. I haven't really even had time to stop and just really cry about this. I grieve on my hour drive to school in the mornings. This is all just too much, but I'm so close to finishing this semester (4 weeks) that I can't bail out now. 

I've just concluded in defeat that I'm just going to take the hit and accept whatever grades I get. As of now I was making a 4.0 on my GPA, and had A's in all of my classes. But both programming classes still have 2 tests, the final, and 2 projects, and my math courses all have copious amounts of homework, 2 more tests, and then the final. I think I can still pass with Bs if I do the bare minimum, which feels like all I can just about do right now.

I guess I just needed to rant. I know that it's not their obligation to cater to my emotional needs but holy fuck, I wasn't expecting the response to be so cold... I was expecting a bit more humanity. That one teacher extending my work by a week so I can grieve was so wonderful. See? I didn't need much. What I needed was my fucking university to treat me like a human being who just had a human tragedy.",4,1,BohemianJack

In the class I took earlier in this series, the lectures were all posted online so you could view them whenever/wherever you wanted to and we had to take regularly scheduled quizzes, exams, do assignments, readings, etc. It was really great because in a class that's entirely non-practical in nature, it makes no sense to make students sit through re-readings of a bunch of powerpoint slides/textbook pages (especially when it's online). However, in the class that I'm in now I just missed a pointless video meeting for the second time this semester and I'm down by a letter grade. I'm curious to know how professors/departments can do this when I as a student am paying for the class and can just read the textbook pages by myself.

Professor told us to expect to study atleast 16 hours every week.  It takes almost 16 hours just to do his homework.  The class is structured so we have 20 problems with online software, plus 5-6 that the prof wrote himself that are hard to understand.  We have two exams, one with online software thats 20 questions  and one hand written.  Written Exams consist of 2 problems that cover easily 30 new equations and new concepts.

I studied by ass off for this last exam, and he included thermo terminology that we never used in class or in the book. He told us what it meant 5 minutes before we had to submit.

We have to do online homework using the online homework tool created by the textbook company. In order to get access to the online homework, you have to buy one of their textbooks ($350 for the physical textbook, $200 for the ebook), and then you need to buy the access code ($30-40 on top of the textbook). So if you take the cheap option you're spending at least $230, but if you buy the print version we're looking at a cost of at least $380...it's a total rip-off.  

So, I usually put up third party cookie blockers on all of my browsers due to my hatred of targeted ads, because I've given up on actual web privacy and now I'm annoyed about the little things. Well, I went in to do the homework for this class at the beginning of the quarter, and it said there was an error with my account. I tried everything, double checked login information and class registration number, and nothing.

Finally, I read on reddit (of all places) that some sites will lock you out of your account if you don't allow them to track all of your activity and sell it to other companies. Sure enough, I turned off my third party cookie blocker and was immediately granted access. I tried making that site the exemption and nope! It still flipped out. 

This means they charge us a ridiculous amount for their actual content and then on top of that, THEY SELL OUR INFO TO OTHER COMPANIES!!!! They make a killing on us, and all we're left with is their crappy glitchy web homework that doesn't even work half the time. I am going to talk to my professor about this tomorrow, but I don't think they have much control over it.

354,mi1qug,2021-04-01 18:31:10,CollegeRant,"I've been in college for two years, but I still can’t move past my regret of not working harder in high school","The title says it all. I am currently a second year computer science major at a C-grade (to be honest, some people even consider it a D-grade school) California State University school. This is all thanks to me slacking off in high school and graduating with a weighted GPA of 3.6, an ACT score of 27, and a lack of extracurriculars and AP classes. Meanwhile some of my friends all worked very hard and ended up in top universities such as Ivies, Stanford and UCs.

&amp;#x200B;

I was initially dejected, but in the first semester of college, I channeled that regret into motivation and found myself working ever so harder than I ever did in all four years of high school and finished the semester with solid A's. I repeated this the next semester and finished with all A's as well, even with the rough transition from in-person to online as COVID hit real hard. Though I was able to motivate myself even more, the regret of not working harder in high school and ending up in a top university continuously lingered in the back of my head whenever I checked the Instagram profile of a high school classmate who got into Berkeley or Stanford or any school that was ranked higher than mine. I vowed to keep up like this for all four years, so I could attend a higher ranking school for grad school.

Overall things have not gone well in the past few months with online school. Though I finished the spring 2020 semester strong, the fall 2020 semester ended terribly. I slowly, but surely became less and less motivated as the weeks of that semester progressed. Dealt with zoom fatigue on a daily basis as all of my classes were synchronous, procrastinated more frequently, missed a few assignments and almost stopped caring about school altogether at one point. I ended the semesters with B's and one failed class (marked on my transcript as ""No Credit"") which I plan on retaking this summer.

I am doing much better this semester though. This semester, I opted for a mix of synchronous and asynchronous classes for the sake of flexibility, and ensured I actively took as many notes as possible. I frequently reviewed my notes and re-watched recorded lectures, went to office hours at least once a week, and turned in all of my assignments on time. I currently hold all A's in my classes.

I'm not sure if this is the right place to get this off my chest, but this regret and guilt is starting to get bad again. Yesterday I started thinking about applying to grad school again, did some research on how to get into a UC grad program, but then ended up watching a series of Youtube videos made by Ivy League students in which they talk about their stats and scores that they worked hard on that got them into those schools. I then went in a negative though spiral in which I continuously beat myself up for not putting more effort into my grades and GPA, not being more active in the clubs I joined, not taking more AP classes, not taking the college application process seriously and just not doing more things overall that would have gotten me into Berkeley or Stanford (my dream schools).

Even if I did well in my first year, and am doing well again in the current semester, I can't stop thinking about how my university ranking and that one bad semester could impact me in the future. I have read stories online about how students from lower ranking state universities have a much harder time landing job interviews and getting employed than Ivy League graduates regardless of whether they the most out of their four years or not. Since I am at such a university, I fear that a no-name university on my resume would still hinder my chances of getting a great job or entrance into a top university for grad school, even if I did maintain good grades and a high GPA, actively participate in clubs, do internships and work on my own side projects for my resume. I also fear that one failed class would hinder my chances as well, even if I pass all my classes with A's and B's the following semester. I also worry about having too many B's on my transcript. I will continue to work hard for the rest of my life, but had I worked harder earlier, I could be in a much better place, constantly feel motivated and end up in a much better place years from now had I started working harder earlier. I can't help but feel that those friends who are attending those top ranking schools will be enjoying a tremendous amount of success in a few years, while I am lagging far behind after graduating from my no-name university.",11,1,shameful_asian_girl

My first year of college, I was pretty lonely as all my high school friends went off to different universities. My second year, I started stepping out of my shell and making new friends. My third year, I really found my stride, made some really good friends, started going to social activities, enjoyed my classes, and boom COVID hit. Now I’ve spent the last year of my life in Zoom university. 

It feels like my brain can’t retain any information anymore. I’ve lost all motivation, because why study when everything is open book and open internet? Why be proactive in class when the professor is just reading off of slides that will be posted online later on? I’m kind of just cruising to the finish line at this point. 

Graduating college used to be my biggest dream, and I couldn’t wait to walk across the stage and receive my diploma with all my friends and family enjoying the day with me but they’ve even cancelled the commencement ceremony. I feel no sense of fulfillment at this point. It’s all kinda just ehhh. 

I really miss being around people my age. I know post graduation depression is real, but I’m feeling it now. To make matters even worse, the job market is so scarce right now as the economy recovers.

359,m749ot,2021-03-17 16:27:22,CollegeRant,I think I’m about to fail a class for the first time,"So for physics 2, which is completely online, I have a professor from Argentina who has a terrible teaching style. He doesn’t give us study guides for the tests so we don’t know what to prepare for. You also aren’t allowed any equation sheet or graphing calculator for the exams when you take it.

I made a 12% on the midterm. The rest of the class did terrible as well and I know this because he curves the class average to a C, which made my grade on the exam go up to about a 40%. Which tells me everyone else got way below a C too. But I’ve still currently have a D overall which is not good, and before the midterm I had a 96. 

I don’t know if I should withdraw or push myself into high gear to get this class done with. If I do withdraw I’ll probably lose a couple scholarships, and there’s no other professors at my college that teach physics 2, so I’d be stuck with him again.

I’m just don’t understand how a professor can see everyone doing shitty on the midterm and not realize it’s on them for the way they teach and expect us to perform.",3,1,darkerthanthenight
360,m6who7,2021-03-17 09:26:05,CollegeRant,The pandemic helped me a lot in school.,"Don't get me wrong, online classes have been a bit of a struggle for me, but before the pandemic I was on academic probation, on the verge of being kicked out, and they were limiting the number of units I could take so I could only take one class a semester. 

Because we can't meet in person to do the things you normally have to do for this, (meetings with counseling, doing workshops, getting your classes approved) they just stopped doing all of it. I can take as many classes as I want now. And I'm in a much better place than I was when I landed myself on academic probation and I'm doing really well with my full time classes. 

I still get a letter every semester basically reminding me that I'm still on probation but there's nothing I have to do. Since I'm able to take more classes I'm getting my GPA up so much faster and after this semester I should be off probation so I'm really thankful for this random side effect of the worst time of my, and many other people's lives.",2,1,ishouldbestudying987

He does publish PowerPoints that are copy and pasted directly from the textbook, but has never ever put out a recorded lecture where he is speaking. Again I actually feel like most online professors are not like this but I've gotten a shitty hand of cards. Not only is this professor in specific unable to communicate with students or teach us anything, he is also really rude and condescending to his students, it is the most unprofessional thing I've come across in 15 years of schooling. This ""teacher"" gives us prompts for essays that are literally less than 10 words long and then complains on a weekly basis that students of the class are not putting enough effort into their work... Again I feel kinda bad judging anyone but he has been incredibly disrespectful and straight up refuses to reply to any politely worded questions I've sent him. It may sound like I'm exaggerating but I promise you I am not. Has anyone else had experiences similar to this? Because frankly I could use some advice to stop me from losing my fucking mind. I am not at all for cancel culture and trying to get people fired, but jesus christ some professors are literally not doing the job of teaching and to me it's appalling, I have no idea how the college board thinks it's okay to charge the same amount for this as an on campus class where a person actually says words to you and acknowledges a students existence. Sorry for the long rant but does anyone feel similarly? I'd really love to know.

362,m6lo1w,2021-03-16 22:50:24,CollegeRant,Online Classes and Professor's Overcompensating for them,"I am taking a brief pause as I study for two exams tomorrow (biochemistry and physics II) to do a little vent and see if other students feel the same as I do.

To start, I am Biomedical Sciences Pre-Medicine and supposedly have a minor in German (haven't taken a class this past year). I am taking 19 hours with research, and I am quite frankly drowning. All of my classes are online either asynchronous or synchronous, which makes classes feel way too optional even though I know they aren't. On top of classes, my professors feel the need to compensate for being online.

I am currently working harder this semester than I ever had in previous semesters to keep up with a course load that I know would never happen if classes were normal. If my professors don't finish during the allotted class time, they post extra lectures outside of class. One of my professors will continue to record after class is technically over, so classes that are supposed to be 50 min long begin to stretch to an hour or even more commonly over 1 hr and 15 min. I have a class after this one, and obviously can't stay, so I am constantly going back over his lecture recordings to review material that ends up being a large portion of the test if you don't go back and watch.

I put off classes to focus on classes that have a test that week, then fall behind. I am constantly playing catch up and feel as if I haven't been able to breathe. I've had one to two tests every week since the beginning of the semester because that's just how much test schedule fell, so once I pass one test, I immediately have to start studying for a different class and playing the catch-up game all over.

I'm killing myself and feel it is really taking a toll on me. I had to quit one of my jobs just to keep up, and now without the income and still doing not as great as I usually do, I can feel it completely wearing me down.

I'm just seeing if anyone else has been feeling this way this semester, and what have they been doing to combat it?",3,1,ailliams
363,m6iltq,2021-03-16 20:29:50,CollegeRant,I got a 17% on a language exam,"My ""break"" (3 day weekend) is during Easter bc I go to Catholic Uni in the states. I know that's more than most students are getting but I'm so burnt out and I don't feel like I'll make it, even if it helps.

My language course has been a train wreck since last semester bc the professor has done very little to make her class transition well to remote learning. I'm learning more from her TA and from online sources than her lectures and the textbook . This is a language I genuinely want to learn for a country I'd like to live in one day, and it's getting very disheartening.

She also seems to be making class significantly harder for me. I have participated a lot in most classes (out of personal spite), and she'll start handing out extra credit to people she calls on so they participate and do the bare minimum in class. She has called me the wrong name multiple times when my name is underneath my face in the magic little boxes we get for Microsoft Teams. I've stopped actively participating in class, and she's stopped offering the ""extra credit"" for everyone. I can't avoid her bc she's the only person who teaches this language at my school, AND she teaches it at the community college I'd attend to try and avoid her.

This exam was INCREDIBLY and too long for the time window she gave us, to the point where most of the class struggled to finish on time. I've never gotten a grade on an exam (especially in a language) where the grade has a similar effect to not taking the exam. There's nothing I can do about the exam grade because she justified everything in her annotations, even though they were mistakes and grammar concepts she has not taught us in a way that made it to my notes.

I've given up on learning with the structure she is trying to use (which is really none at all), and I'm just learning it on my own. Unfortunately, it's not helping me on exams",5,1,discerningpotato

Every day I sit down to study and get so overwhelmed or sad or angry that I cry or I procrastinate, and I've never been a procrastinator. I have so much to do! SO MUCH! And the best thing is that I DONT LIKE ANY OF IT! I make good grades, but I can't go to grad school because I can't get the rec letters required because 3 of my 4 semesters as an engineering student have been online and we all know how online class goes.

I applied to summer research programs and I've been rejected by all of them. So I have to scramble to find an engineering internship this summer so I can get a stupid engineering job when I graduate. Yeah, I know I don't have to go into engineering, but what the fuck else am I going to do? I have no clue what I want to do. All I want rn is a low stress job and free time so I can do outdoor activities all the time and have time for other hobbies. I love the outdoors and it's the reason I chose my major, but because of these fucking classes and the extracurricular hoops I feel I have to jump through, I haven't been hiking since July. I don't have time. I spend all day every day studying. I don't know when the last time I had an active hobby besides exercising was.

I don't want to get an engineering job or internship but I have to if I'm going to get a job. Maybe I'll transition to teaching or do environmental science instead. I just am so angry at myself for choosing this STUPID major and going to this STUPID school and I can't switch programs because I don't have money and I have to leave my college town before I lose my mind. 

AND my stress levels are through the roof and I DONT GET A FUCKING BREAK because my school canceled spring break and I really can't deal with it. I don't know how I'm gonna make it through another 8 weeks with 5 projects due, at least 2 more tests per class, work, extracurricular responsibilities, and finals. Like fuck, I'd rather just drop out but then I REALLY don't know what I'm gonna do. 

I have a lot more to say but idk how to articulate it. It all sucks. Yes I'm on medication for depression that works well, that's not an issue. Starting anxiety meds for the first time tomorrow. I can't afford a therapist and I've used all my university's free sessions. My friends are tired of hearing me complain/agonize and I'm sick of keeping this bottled up. Normally I'd run a lot to get bad vibes out but I can't even do that because I strained my fucking calf and elliptical and bike don't hit the same. I just needed to vent.

365,m5nxvt,2021-03-15 16:01:45,CollegeRant,"I just want to graduate already, but I'm afraid I've messed up","I'm supposed to graduate this semester. I'm taking 6 classes: 4 entirely online, and 2 mixed. I know we've been doing online work for a while now and I should be used to it and able to organize all my work, but...it would be nice to get an email once a week saying ""these are the things due"". Two of my classes don't even have syllabi and I'm usually late turning stuff in because due dates seem to just randomly appear. 

My in person classes are the worst, though. I hate going in person once a day for a one hour class that I could just as easily do online. And because they're in person, there's an attendance policy. I don't think I've gone over my amount of allowed absences, but I skipped today (my car broke down last night and I don't have a ride to class because I don't know anyone driving to campus today) and now I'm freaking out, worried that I won't graduate because I'm going to fail for being absent too often. 

While my biggest worry is attendance, my second biggest worry is passing one of my classes specifically. Made a 64 on the test today and my homework grade averages at a 20%--I'm doing all the homework, it's just really hard! AND I'm looking up the answers! It's French 202 and my professor is awful; he starts classes 30 minutes lates and expects us to stay 30 minutes after. His vocab quizzes are super ambiguous pictures we're supposed to identify (our last chapter had us identify via stock images vocab terms such as printed, media, newspaper, report, and copy....no one in the class made above a 40). He doesn't attend his office hours and he isn't much help in class, usually having us do fill-in-the-blank worksheets instead of explaining concepts. He gives us 60 minute tests with 150 questions and usually only gives us a warning about a test a day in advance (he's one of my professors without a syllabus).

My parents support me financially and I am incredibly grateful for that (They are against me getting a job because they had it rough financially when they were young and rather me focus on school). When I was deciding where to go for college they told me that as long as tuition was covered they would pay my housing, but if I lost my scholarship I would have to transfer somewhere close to home because they would only pay one not both. I agreed because I was always a good student so I never anticipated this being a problem. 

Online learning has been a nightmare for me and I failed one class last semester and might fail another this semester. If I fail this semester I’ll lose my financial aid. I do not want to go back home as i’m very happy at this university. I obviously don’t expect my parents to pay for my shortcomings so I would just take out loans, but the issue is that is exactly what they did not want for me.

They did not take it well when I failed that class last semester and i’m terrified to tell them about this one especially when so much more is at stake.

Seems from my research that many colleges use this as a primary source. I’m taking Math 1190 (business calculus). Last semester I dropped the class as I have always struggled in math and couldn’t figure it out. This semester my college offered it in person (instead of online). I took this thinking it would be different but the lectures are just in person but homework, is of course, through fucking Knewton. I type in an answer from my calculator and it marks it wrong. Why? Because apparently I should’ve rounded although it doesn’t say to round. I get 2 questions right in a row, it sends me the quick review. Quick review has to be the worst aspect of it all.

372,m2ldl2,2021-03-11 08:17:49,CollegeRant,I'm about to fail a class for the second time and I have no idea how to cope.,"Hi. This is my first time posting to Reddit, so I have no clue if I'm doing this right, or if this will reach anybody, but at this point I'm not sure where else to turn. I think I've exhausted the subject with my roommates, and I just need somewhere to vent. So this is long, which I think goes against the grain of normal Reddit posts (from what I've seen).

I'm currently a biology major at a state university. I'm almost done with my degree - if I pass all my classes this semester I will only need 13 credits left to graduate, which means I'd actually be graduating a semester earlier than anticipated. I haven't had an internship yet, although I'm trying to secure one for this summer. I have a bit of research experience under my belt (unfortunately, my time in the lab was cut short due to the pandemic), and I'm a part of my school's Honors Program. My grades aren't the *best* in the world, but they're still pretty good - I've gotten A's in the vast majority of my classes, B's in two of them, and one C in calculus.

My real problem is organic chemistry. When I took O. Chem I last fall, I got a D in the class. And I won't make excuses, I take full responsibility for that, I did not put in the effort I should have. Then I had a really rough start the next semester with O. Chem II (I was sort of dealing with my first heartbreak, which is very cliché of me, but regardless I fell behind very quickly). By the time we had our second exam I was doing so badly in the class that I decided to withdraw and take another stab at it in the summer. I even planned on retaking O. Chem I first. I was actually looking forward to retaking them this way, because then I would've been able to focus all of my attention on O. Chem without having to worry about any other courses.

Lo and behold, a global pandemic hit, and my university cancelled most of their summer classes. So I'm taking O. Chem II again this spring, along with four other courses. And it's going pretty badly.

I managed to just scrape a C on the first exam (I know that doesn't sound like a big deal to most people, but for me in this course, that might as well be an A+). I've done pretty well on the homework assignments so far, as they're fairly simple. The weekly quizzes have been hit or miss.

But our second exam is coming up within the next couple of days, and I have barely looked at any of the material. I am absolutely terrified. I don't understand what's wrong with me. I could've made time for it, I just...didn't. I kept telling myself, and other people, *repeatedly:* ""My test is coming up, so I really need to study for that."" And then I just didn't!

To be honest I have been really struggling to keep up with the work in all my classes. I'm not sure if I'm feeling this way because of the extenuating circumstances of *trying to be in college during a global pandemic* or if I'm just burnt out. Most of my classes are online, with lectures over zoom. I'm still doing pretty well in 4/5 of them (the obvious exception being O. Chem), but I feel like it's taking so much out of me to achieve that. It's taking a herculean effort to get my work done when it shouldn't be.

I definitely prioritize my other classes over O. Chem, even though that's the one that requires the most studying. I guess the logic behind it is that I know my other grades will suffer if I backburner everything just to spend all my time looking at chemistry. Because I know that even if I do that, it's still very unlikely that I would get anything higher than a C in the class. And I can't justify getting mediocre grades in classes where I know I can do really well for the sake of doing *just a little bit better* in chemistry.

I've always struggled with anxiety, and it got a lot better once I graduated high school, but it's come back with a vengeance this semester. I'm barely sleeping. I stay up all hours of the night, not because I'm up doing homework, but more often than not because I'm terrified of going to sleep, and having to wake up in the morning and face another day of school. One day I woke up for class, shut off my alarm, and just burst into tears because I couldn't stand the thought of having to sit through another lecture. I've been having crying fits almost every day, just out of nowhere, totally uncontrollably. Sometimes it happens more than once in a day. I've been picking at my scalp like crazy, which is a nervous habit I struggle with on and off, but it's been so bad lately that I'm giving myself headaches. I've been having panic attacks. I'm overeating. I haven't been able to go home in over a month because my work is piling up, and I miss my family. I feel like I've barely spoken to any of my friends. I feel like I haven't even seen much of my roommates, because I barely leave my room now.

I feel like all my motivation is gone. I'm stressed about all the work I need to do and the work I haven't done, but instead of that stress putting pressure on me to get going, I just feel paralyzed. I get so overwhelmed that I just think ""is there even a point of me trying to do all this?"" It feels impossible. I feel like I'm drowning. I've had a handful of days where I couldn't even bring myself to get out of bed.

I used to be a good student, now I can barely get through the week.

Just thinking about the amount of material I haven't learned in O. Chem is making me nauseous. What's even worse is knowing that I did it to myself. I sat at my desk, and kept telling myself I'd look at the textbooks, that I'd watch the recorded lecture again, that I'd do the practice problems. And then I didn't. I don't know why, but I just couldn't bring myself to do it. I am certainly going to fail my next exam, and I'm somehow both horrified by and totally numb to the prospect.

I had a hard time being social but I looked forward to going to class. I enjoyed discussing things and being around people even if I didn’t know anyone. 

I can’t even muster up the energy to panic about anything anymore or enjoy the little things. I think it’s the apathy that’s made it so bad. I’ve felt with depression and stress. But I don’t think I’ve ever felt this hopeless and apathetic. And the funny thing is that apathy is a reason I don’t really get help.

I already have my degree and am pursuing another out of fun and a few other things.

I'm just going to jump right into it. I dislike that classes have been split and we are only doing part time on ground. I have a physics lecture that is all online by choice, but the lab time has been cut in half. It seems like we just do the experiment, take data and have to do write ups. In theory, in a regular class time, we would have time to do the experiment and then start our calculations in class so our instructor can help. That isn't the case and sure, I am worried because I want to do my best in class, I stay after but what about the kids pursing their first degree? Why is this their first experience?

I had a semester check in with my counselor and voiced my issues. I don't mean to be inconsiderate, but if you are scared to attend school because of a virus, take the semester off or go fully online. I understand there are people with health concerns which is obviously different. Shifting the burden to your students by cutting their class time isn't the answer. It is such a shame. I do love all of my professors and even though grades are taking EVEN longer, I have empathy. I myself am a middle school teacher and love my students and understand the teaching grind in some capacity.

There is no perfect solution here but staying up many hours to solve a problem that could be fixed isn't my problem. It shouldn't be students problem either.

The plan is to, keep trucking along. I did drop out of college way back in my freshman year and after completing my degree after going back to school, the hell if I am going to quit anything again. I am going down doing my best but if you are in the same boat, I feel you.",13,12,AE3Fitness

Basically, she's talking to herself the whole time and asks why we as a class are so unresponsive when she literally doesn't give us any time to answer the bloody question. Whenever someone tries to jump in to answer the question she just ends up interrupting them as she is answering the question at the same time (the one she just asked less than a second back) making the whole situation awkward as fuck because she literally just cut the person answering off. The only question she actually asks that is given ample time to answer is ""do you guys have any questions"" and with no response to that, one of us has to interject every 20 seconds to just say no... because clearly at that point no one has questions...(I mean that is literally the one question you can answer for yourself because clearly if no one is asking a question no one has one? it like asking ""who here is absent""). I've been telling this professor that she needs to give us the students at least a couple of seconds to answer her questions and to continue showing the question on the board (its usually a word problem with a table) so we can at least have a chance, or at least post the word problem online so we can look at that crap too while she is lecturing. Apparently, she feels as if we should just be more enthusiastic and that she gives us enough time, granted I guess the students aren't exactly the most enthusiastic bunch in the morning but still it makes the lecture seem rushed and awkward because she is trying to make it interactive when in truth it's not.

tl:dr- the professor is trying to make an interactive class but really shouldn't, by asking questions and yet answering it herself makes the question she asked in the first place pointless and thereby really just wastes time.",2,9,Fuckingevicerateme
381,lqwa3w,2021-02-23 23:24:22,CollegeRant,Parents think online college classes are easier than inperson,"Sort of a rant post but I need to get this off my chest.

I am currently a freshman, 2nd semester. I take college class at my home because of the COVID pandemic. Anyways, the professors send a TON of work through zoom/online and I feel this has made it much more difficult to actually pay attention/care about class since everything is online. I have like 3 group projects from different classes and nobody in the groups wants to do work (so I am doing all of them by myself). Also, a ton of online exams and no breaks. I'm basically at my home like many of you for hours at a day looking at the computer screen and watching professors give a super monotone class thanks to COVID.

Anyways, because of all the stress I have, I told my parents about all of my assignments and stuff and how it sucked to not be at the college campus, etc. My parents legit started scolding me and telling me I'm lazy for not being grateful that I have online classes instead of traditional in-class courses. They think with today's tech and especially zoom that college is 10x easier and that my stress is dumb/exaggerated. I was so angry with them that I went back to my room to cry because I definitely am NOT lazy at all. I have been in dean's list before and everything yet they swear that since college is now online that I shouldn't complain about the difficulty. I also have tutors but even then college is still very difficult for me especially mathematical-type courses.

They'll start saying things like ""When I was in college, we had to use typewriters and stayed until 3AM! No fancy internet!"", etc. I understand there was no internet back then but they should consider that college will always be difficult no matter the timeline.

What do I do? I have way too many assignments, never given anything late, always go to class, and my parents think I am lazy and that college is ""easy"". I just want to explode.

TL;DR : parents think modern online class is easier than inperson class from their time because of technology, even though I am drowning in work/stress. Am I wrong?",4,38,Oro-Lavanda

Had to drive 30 minutes to class each day just to show up and have a college sub “take roll” and then leave before we found out the school was lying to us. Turns out we didn’t have to do that and the school needed attendance records to maintain federal funding.

Once school went back to normal a month later, we were so behind that we just crammed the whole semester into the last 2/3 of the year. Struggled my ass off because I was a horrible high school student and went straight to the military. My brain turned to mush for 8 years but I unfucked it. 2 Cs and a D. Terrible.

Semester 2: Dope. Full time in person and all A’s and a B.

Semester 3: Dope. Same as 2 but went to online classes at the end of the semester. Almost had all As but fell off the wagon on one class and got a B.

Semester 4: Wildly stupid and hard to learn online. I got a C and took a math class for the first time in 7 years. 

Semester 5 (this semester): Wildly stupid and hard to learn. None of the teachers have a standardized way of posting assignments online. Was thinking about a quiz that was due available between 6-10 PM and happened to fucking forget about it until exactly at 10 PM.

I was on a sports team so I allowed back and it was so nice... we had maybe 60 cases (on and off campus) throughout the entire semester, everyone was getting tested, and I could safely hang out with my teammates and a few other friends. Covid restrictions became way too much in relation to what I was actually getting out of it so I quit (I wasn’t on scholarship anyway) and moved off campus for the spring with girls I met online.

The university decided to bring most of the regular student body back (almost the entire freshman class and anyone else willing to shell out the money) and cases immediately surged. Tons of party videos went viral, which embarrassed admin, too. They put a temporary “social lockdown” in place meaning you weren’t supposed to socialize outside of your dorm building/apartment. 

One of the girls I live with is being realistic about it (we obviously have to leave to get food but we’ve both seen two friends total since it went in place) while my other roommates are going out to parties every weekend and loudly brag about making out with guys they just met, make plans to travel, and refuse to get tested. They keep to their rooms for the most part and the two of us who take it seriously get tested twice a week, so I’m not too concerned from a health standpoint, but damn, it’s hard to know I can’t see my responsible friends and former teammates because people like them can’t go a weekend without partying.

388,locg8e,2021-02-20 17:51:04,CollegeRant,Absolute awful experience with one of these Global campuses,"I have a bachelor's degree from over 12-years ago, and I was attempting to do a career pivot. As a working professional, I needed a post-bachelor's program that offered flexibility. I started an accounting program at one of these new-ish online Global campuses. Specifically, I started at Colorado State University-Global. My experience has been downright awful and miserable.

They say the program is designed to be flexible for working adults. Except that the instructor's office hours and availability is mostly M-F, 8-5. Turn around times on questions have varied from a few to 24 to 36 hours or not at all. They're also supposed to have two live sessions a term. Most of the time, they either don't do them or will post something a few hours before they are hosting one. One of the instructors sent an invite to his live session a few hours before, and it was on the Saturday evening between Christmas and New Years break.

The instructors are more like part-time mediators than actual instructors. They don't teach the class. They don't have any input in the design of the curriculum. They don't seem to understand the technology that is used for the courses. I had issues with the 3rd party McGraw Hill system they use and they have told me they don't know how to fix it.

They say they have tutors available, except that it's a 3rd party service that doesn't have any real insights into what you're working on and are not helpful at all.

I asked the instructor for clarification on a recent assignment. I explained how I had worked it out and she told me that sounded correct, so I submitted it as such. And it was actually wrong.

My first instructor in ACT300 mistakenly sent out the entire term's worth of assignments answer key on week 1. There were several mistakes in the learning modules and on the assignment templates. I brought some of these up to him, and he told me that I ""had everything I needed"".

These institutions quite literally do not seem to know what they are doing. It seems like a half-baked execution at best. The instructors do not seem to really care about your success, as for most of them it's just a part-time side hustle. They aren't available when you need them and they seemed to give half-assed responses to inquiries.

392,lmaj73,2021-02-18 01:40:26,CollegeRant,Kinda freaking out after a situation with the dean and my professor,"So I have a class that is taught partially on Zoom and partially in person. It's taught by one professor only and is required for me to graduate in my major. 

Last semester and this semester, when I've had classes that are partially live and partially on Zoom, my professors have all offered the option to attend class via Zoom on days that you cannot attend in-person for any reason, including if you're sick. When you can't make it to either option, they've still been very lenient and understanding. The general understanding on my campus is that if you're not feeling good to any degree, do not come even if you don't think it's COVID. Then the professors are supposed to try and work with you. 

Now for my current professor in this particular class:
I wasn't feeling good near the end of last week, and we had an in person class on Friday. This professor does not offer a Zoom alternative for in person classes. So, if you miss class, you have to find out exactly what exercises/activities happened that day and what assignments were assigned from various students if you can get ahold of them. Additionally, if any student misses 1 and a half classes without an 'excuse', they are supposed to be dropped from the class. Excuses are to be turned in by the start of the next class after your absence. 

I emailed my professor and said that I was not feeling well and asked them what they thought I should do. They told me not to come to class, and then stated ""as stated in the syllabus, you'll have to have a doctor's note if you don't want your absence to be unexcused"". They worded their email as though they were annoyed that I even contacted them in the first place. Now, in the syllabus, they define an unexcused absence as ""an absence that is not excused"". That is the exact wording. Now here's my problem with the doctor's notes:
My doctors office is backed up with appointments and sometimes you cannot get one for weeks. I needed my excuse within a week. 

It is very expensive to go to the doctor in general, even using one of those online doctor's note services. But especially every time I feel sick enough that the campus themselves does not want me there. 

If I would have had COVID, I do not want to be walking into a doctor's office. 

If I don't have COVID, I would really be wasting the doctor's time. 

All of my other professors only had/have an issue with you being entirely absent if you miss like 3 classes or so without speaking to them first. These professors also of course offer Zoom alternatives in the first place. 

I had told my professor that my symptoms aligned with some COVID symptoms, and asked if a COVID test would suffice as a doctor's note. They said yes. So my only options were to spend the money to (hopefully be able to get scheduled to) go to the doctor or to drive 40 mins minimum (one way) for a COVID test. Now, we have to do these things every single time we feel even somewhat sick because the campus does not want us there if we don't feel good to any degree. I'm not sure what would happen if you couldn't get a doctors appointment or COVID test scheduled in time.
I did not even trust myself to be driving because of how fatigued I was, and having to drive myself so far honestly did exacerbate my symptoms. 
My professor treats the pre-COVID syllabus as the law of the land and has not created any leniency due to COVID really at all. I felt like other students deal with professors acting like this as well, and my professor just so happens to be the head of the department I'm in, so I decided to go to the dean about my concerns. I would have not complained were we not in a pandemic, but I feel like there needs to be at least a little leniency right now. I felt like these strict rules were unfair to me and my classmates during this pandemic, especially as we have to take this class with this specific professor. If there was a Zoom alternative to the in person classes, I would have been there and participating however I could. A Zoom alternative would also eliminate the need for such frequent doctor's appointments and COVID tests. 

I asked the dean if I could remain anonymous should they bring up my concerns to my professor. Well..that didn't happen. I sent my COVID test excuse to my professor today and they responded by saying ""as stated in my previous emails, I only needed a reciept of your appointment as an excuse. I don't know why you felt the need to go over my head to the dean about it."" 

I had a mini panic attack when I read that. Everyone I've talked to agrees that what I did is reasonable and understandable but still...ugh",14,1,starblizzard

394,lkrdp2,2021-02-16 00:30:27,CollegeRant,I've had it with my Java professor!,"Background: I am a bachelor's level IT major with a concentration on web app development

This semester got off to a rocky start for me (5 weeks ago). I'm taking three classes, and one of my classes I'm quickly beginning to outright hate. 

This particular class is Jakarta EE dev (basically building jsp projects and servlets using apache Tomcat and eclipse IDE). 

If that wasn't english enough, here's what it boils down to: 
I'm using two different programs on my computer to create websites in a programming language called Java. 

My issues with the professor for this class started when he didn't tell the school library that we needed a textbook for the class, even though the book was listed in the syllabus. Because of some dumb rule, I wasn't allowed to purchase my textbook using my financial aid like normal. I had to rent the book or buy it out of pocket. So, I paid like 20 bucks to rent it on Amazon for the whole semester. Last week, I sit down to do my assignment for the week, and one of the program I was using was throwing errors (not working) like it was supposed even though I hadn't even started writing code. I contact my professor, and he hops on a ms teams calm with me and helps me sort out the issue. I honestly don't know what the issue was. 

Fast forward to this week and I am beyond pissed off. I go to start working on this week's assignment, opening the program like my professor told me to last week, and lo and behold I have more issues. I try to do the lesson, but the tutorial thing in the book doesn't make sense and my program isn't cooperating with me. So I email my professor explaining that I'm stuck and need help again. 

He gets on ms teams with me and looks at a couple things and then proceeds to tell me to go buy another computer or use a computer at the school. If I want to try to use my computer, the best way to fix it is to do a complete OS reinstall. I would have been fine taking his advice, as he does know more about the program than I do, but the way he worded it and his tone of voice was all arrogant like and ""I'm better than you so just trust me blindly"" -_-

I don't have 2k to drop on a computer right now. As it is, the computer I have is a microsoft surface pro 6 and I haven't had any trouble out of it with any other program. It's literally just this one. I'm not reinstalling my OS just because some program won't work. My first instinct is to uninstall the program and reinstall it. I live in a rural area, so going to school to do assignments for one class (which is supposed to be ONLINE) is gonna suck. 30-40 mins to get to school from my house plus that's extra gas money out of my pocket each week. (Semester is 16 weeks long and I'm only on week 5). 

TL;DR: Professor didn't tell the college bookstore that I needed a textbook so I had to pay out of pocket for it. The same teacher didn't really help me with my issues with an assignment and literally told me to buy another computer or completely reinstall my OS. His tone of voice and wording were very arrogant and he basically demanded that the only way to fix the issue was with one of his solutions. But his solutions were nuclear in scope.",4,1,Littlebitt95

I could just coast, not worry about my grades, but I don't have the privilege of being a C student. I need to maintain a 3.2 GPA to keep one of my scholarships. 4-year college was a mistake. I should've gone into one of those 2-year paralegal programs. I hate this. Especially with online school and stupid deadlines and pressure from my parents... I can't even get a job because I'm too slow and stupid to work and do school at the same time. I just turned in 2 assignments a few hours late late, and I'm just praying the professors aren't too anal about that stuff... I just want to paint and drink all day and go outside and shoot the shit with my friends... And I feel terrible about this because my dad went to law school, however he couldn't use his degree so he ended up with a generic labor job and I need to achieve what he couldn't. He went to fucking LAW SCHOOL and can't even get a 3.2 GPA during my freshman year, and isn't this supposed to be the easiest year? I don't know how people sit and study all day. I suppose I should do that too. 

3 more years of this shit. 3 more years of writing. I hate this. I want to transfer to a paralegal program so I can skip this college bullshit but I don't even know if that's possible. I will be emailing my career counselor for this. 

I have a friend who's terrible at school, failing every class, probably won't go to college(still in hs) but it seems he has his shit together better than me. Fuck this.",24,1,Brilliant-Profit4514

When I applied to my community college back in early spring of 2020, I thought that the pandemic might be over or slowing down by late summer , God was I totally wrong. Doing college online as a drama major, sucks. I'm doing the same things I did in high school and in one of my major classes, we almost always watch Youtube videos for the entire class. With no auditions around and not having the equipment to start voice acting. It feels like I'm preparing for nothing. 

I want to drop out of college, but I want to come back when the pandemic ends and when I built my resume a little more. Luckily it's community college so there's really only a few thousand dollars to lose. 

I told my parents multiple times and they're not understanding why I want to. They dismiss it as if I'm lazy and I'll be throwing away everything. What hurts me more is that they think it's selfish. Someone else is paying for my education even when I hopefully transfer and I could lose that if I drop out. I'm aware of it. But there's more reasons to take a break than to stay. 

I hope to transfer into a musical theater program and it's extremely difficult to get into one. Judging from research it looks like that most of the people auditioning have been training since they were in elementary school. I've only got into the game in 2018 as a high school junior. If I continue I don't think I'll be prepared at all and have an incomplete education. Which is also what I told my parents.

Why not talk to the person paying my education? Unfortunately he is my mom's boss. When talking about this with my mom, she always points out that it'll make us look bad and again lose the funding. 

Why don't you have scholarships? I've applied to multiple and never got chosen. We've submitted forms to verify my FAFSA but it's been months and nothing.

Going to college immediately after high school was something I never wanted even before the pandemic. I had a plan on what would I do during a period between graduation and college. Even if I never went to college, I would be ok with it.  But unfortunately my parents weren't interested in even considering it. 

So I guess I'm forced to get an incomplete education. 

TLDR: College drama major forced to continue college because of parents not being understanding and worrying that the person paying my education won't pay it again if I return to college after a gap ""until the pandemic is over"". If I continue I'll have an incomplete education and not be prepared when auditioning for universities to transfer to.",4,2,PhamLiJuuls

I could watch the lectures whenever I wanted, I could pause to take notes, rewind, watch at a faster speed. It was effing awesome. I’m guessing over the winter break faculty must have had some sort of meeting to encourage more student participation or something because in several of my classes they now throw us into breakout rooms with the same technique of having to elect a student speaker depending on some random butt question. For example, “the speaker of your group will be whoever has the most amount of pets”, and suddenly everyone claims to have zero pets, even the people who clearly have profile pics of them holding their pets.... “the speaker of your group will be whoever’s birthday is coming up the earliest? “ all of a sudden everyone’s birthday was last week. Most of the time we get thrown into breakout rooms for majority of the class and no one speaks. I have tried several times to speak to my classmates but I’m lucky if I even get a response back. I’m not sure if they are shy, still asleep, or just don’t care but at this point I’m starting to not care as well. I hate breakout rooms! Either teach/ lecture or let us go there is no point in being thrown in with people who refuse to discuss or participate.

404,lcixey,2021-02-04 16:05:46,CollegeRant,Frustrated with myself because I feel like I've barely gotten any schoolwork done this week,"Hi everyone,

school started this week for me. This entire year has been hell so far. I'm working 10-12 hours a week (more than that before the semester started) at a shitty grocery store, on top of getting another job as an RA and doing 19 credits (including a 400 level research seminar, I'm a sophomore but my advisor said I have to take it now due to how many credits I have). I've had a lot of family stuff going on, including an abusive person I haven't talked to in 18 months contacting me because they have COVID. I'm losing my hair massively, like literally to the point where one of my coworkers thought i dyed it because it looks lighter due it all falling out. I'm trying to be healthy by going to the gym- just about the only healthy thing im doing in my life right now, although it can't be that healthy because it slightly became an obsession with me going 7 days a week. I was going to take a leave of absence from work at the grocery store, but now thats not really an option due to me having to dish out hundreds of dollars in dental bills that I accidentally accrued (long story). My mom got a puppy, even though I already have three dogs. Everyone at work hates me, and I left yesterday because I had a breakdown due to abusive person calling me during work. I have barely seen my girlfriend at all, so i somehow have to maintain my relationship on top of all of this. I have church obligations every sunday and monday as well. This is the long way of saying how stressful my life has been recently, without even counting school.

On top of all of this, now I am doing school. I have been so preoccupied with my life that i have barely had anytime to do schoolwork. And frankly, I don't really want to do it. I have all online classes, either on zoom or just on blackboard. Yesterday was the hardest for me. I had my research seminar from 9-12, and then had a one hour break where i had to go to the dentist to pick up a referral before going right back to class from 1:10 to 2:30. I then had an appointment at 3:30 which was 30 minutes away. By the time I was done with everything I had to do yesterday, my brain was so fried that I just went straight to my girlfriends house and watched youtube. I went to the gym at like 9:15 until they closed, and i showered and went to bed. Not exactly a productive day.

Today I'm struggling to get motivated. Just the thought of looking at my to do list makes me want to go to sleep. I've had coffee and its doing nothing for me. I just don't want to exist right now. I have online zoom class in an hour and then i have more errands to run. I dont want to do anything, I just want to sit in my bed and sleep. I feel very unproductive and it gives me anxiety that im not doing anything, but the thought of doing anything also gives me anxiety. I feel paralyzed.

Before anyone suggests it, yes, I see a therapist. I'm talking to him tonight.

Does anyone have any suggestions on how to get out of this? I know that this is a rant sub, but any suggestions from people who may have struggled to get motivated would be great as well.

Thank you

TL;DR: My life sucks right now with a lot going on, and I'm paralyzed and feel like i physically cannot do any schoolwork. ",2,10,hobgoblins46

I would understand if it went to maybe $5k but...isn’t this a lot to increase with no warning or notice?? I have a lot of scholarships at my school and apparently it didn’t cover it. I have $40k per year in scholarships and i’m not even dorming. EVERYTHING IS ONLINE! they won’t offer a discount because SOME students are allowed on campus. I’ve already called Financial Aid office and they aren’t clear where all the expenses are going to and why it increased so much other than telling me “we took off the online course discount”. I don’t have much time left to pay or register for some of my courses. I was only going to take 14 credits this semester, but my school is charging me full tuition as if I am taking 18 credits so now I have to quickly find a random elective class to enroll in by tommorow to make my money worth it...

Anyways, I will try to deal with the problem to reduce the tuition hopefully for me, because I truly have been busting my ass off last semester to get good grades and earn the money to pay for this semester. I saved up exactly $2.5k while working last semester to pay to my school for the current spring semester while being a full time student and worked as much as I could to the bone. If they had made it clear to me why I was being charged so much, then I would understand and I won’t complain. But they couldn’t even tell me why the price was so much. I tried asking my friends about it but they don’t really care of havent looked into it because they aren’t spending their own money, it’s their parents (I go to a private school and everybody has their parents paying for them is what I observed. I chose my school because it’s the only one close by with my programs, and hell i only had to pay around $2k per semester so far ! I’ve had a lot of great opportunities here! ) I just wish somebody in my school was able to relate to me and offer some advice/guidance but I’ve come up with dead ends.

406,lbqkzy,2021-02-03 15:54:05,CollegeRant,Whoever decided on a half online class needs to be fired.,"Yes, I get that we can't do normal classes because of COVID. Yes, this class has enough students so that they all can't fit in a classroom with social standing (even though just skipping a seat isn't really enough, but oh well). But screw this class.

I have to take a physics class for my major and it's a Monday-Thursday class and they decided that the class would be split in half, with a half goes to class (with the other half attending though a Webex link), and then the next day the halves switch roles. So when you are in the class room everything is good, but you will hate life when you are in the Webex room. The professor's microphone cuts out a lot, the webcam is at best a 480p  camera (to the point that you can't tell the difference between a E and q), and the digital class itself cuts out at times. We have a group chat for this class and during class it is filled with people asking ""what did she write?"", ""what did she say"", ""did the class cut out?"", ""is her audio choppy to anyone else?"" and so forth. Also she has the sound muted on the computer so if you have a question when you're online you hope that someone in class has the Webex open. Also she doesn't record these, so if you miss anything, oh well.

I have to admit on paper this seems like a good idea, but damn if these people didn't ruin the execution. I know for a fact they can afford decient cameras and microphones (they charge $1000 per student, 30+ students and that's just this class), but nah, let's buy the cheapest and lowest quality webcam we can find.

I've had some truly challenging classes over the years. I'm in health education, and I have made deans list every semester for two years. I'm not saying I'm that smart, I just do whatever work I'm assigned. Usually the professors I have want me to succeed. Usually.

Look I've had some shitty professors. I've had some downright mean ones. Normally I just keep my head down, do the work, roll my eyes, and then I get a passing grade. But this one? Oh man he makes me so angry I don't know what to do.

Lets call him Professor A. I've had professor A before for a course, but it was online. And he was absolutely a dickhead back then, but it was tolerable since it was online.

Although, I have to say I should have known he was going to be a shithead when he assigned us homework that was just to listen to four 2 hour and 30 minute Sam Harris podcasts and ""explain why he's right""....

I swear to god this man hates teaching. For context, he is teaching a course that deals with Community Health and wellness planning. It's not rocket science, but today he made it incredibly clear to everyone he is going to make this PAINFUL for us.

I just finished our first zoom class. Here is what he said and what he had written in his ""syllabus"", which he basically recited to the class. 

""I want all my students to be successful. And I will determine if you are successful based off the intelligence you exhibit. If you can prove to me that you are intelligent, you might do decent in this class.""

\&gt; Really. Reducing every one of us down to fit into the category of ""intelligent"" or ""not intelligent"" based on your arbitrary standards. 

""Do any of you know what the difference between an A student and a B student is? Every semester I have a student email me upset because they must get an A-, and right now they're at a B. So I get to sit them down and have this conversation. I say to them-- you tell me, what does an A student look like? Does it look like someone who fails to turn in work and makes excuses? No. Do you think you *deserve* an A? \[....\] **When someone gets a B in my class it is because they were too lazy or too unintelligent to get an A. And I believe you all have the capacity to be intelligent, so my expectations are that you will all get an A. And if not, well, you just have to live with that**.""

\&gt; Holy. Fucking. Shit. As someone who's made Deans List with a couple B grades, this is the most toxic shit I've ever heard. Getting a B or even a B- is literally fine. Did you understand the concepts? If so, then good. Move on. Who gives a shit what arbitrary letter this professor feels like giving you?

""copying what a source said verbatim is not permitted in this course. you can put quotes around it and cite the source and explain it, but it's still copying, and this is a 400 level course so I expect for you to be able to refrain from this.""

\&gt;I... what? But he kept going:

""You need to add something to the field of study. If you're writing a paper and your paper is just a dry explanation of the material and how well you understand it, that's not going to cut it. I want you to make bold claims and back them up. Because when you make those claims, it gives us a chance to prove them false, which is a very important skill.""

\&gt; I think I kind of understand what he maybe was getting at in the first half, but not the second part. I think he meant to say ""I want you to sound stupid in your papers so I can say that you're stupid""

He expanded upon this for another TEN MINUTES at which point he said this:

""Its okay to disagree with me. I value it. I enjoy when students try to disagree. I welcome hearing your perspectives. At the end of the day, I will walk away from the argument knowing I'm right, and you've just made my argument stronger by pointing out all of the perceived weaknesses.""

**This hyper-rationalist persona he's cramming down our throats is so fucking obnoxious. He's like the greasy incel alt-right kid you went to high school with who always butts in and is like ""well ACTUALLY,"" and ""let me tell you why you're wrong--""**

And don't get me fucking started on *RESPONDUS LOCKDOWN BROWSER WITH WEBCAM*. That shit is fucking disgraceful and the fact that colleges even allow that to be implemented is disturbing.

My college has this policy on Respondus that basically says ""it's up to the professor, but most of our professors find this software unnecessary."" This professor loves it and had a lot to say about it:

""I caught several students cheating using respondus lockdown browser last semester. It was suspected that they were looking things up on their phones. And yes, they did get penalized. **That's why I record your web cam feed during exams. I really take my time scrubbing through those videos looking for evidence that you are cheating.** I have to. If it looks to me like you are looking elsewhere in your room, or possibly cheating, I have to investigate that.""

\&gt;Yeah, fuck cheating-- but seriously??? Fucking creepy. I don't even know what to think anymore. I took upper level math last semester and my professor didn't bother with the webcam feature. And that was MATH-- arguably the class where students are going to want to cheat most.

And to close it out we have the most disturbing thing he said the whole two hours:

""I'm very good at telling when someone is lying and cheating. And those are two things that get on my nerves. I hate to say it but those things really tick me off. \[at this point he just paced at the front of the classroom nodding solemnly and it was so cringe\] And I am well within my rights to get angry. If I think that you're cheating, there really isn't anything you can do to convince me otherwise, because I'm usually right. A lot of students get upset about that. But I'm well within my rights.""

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR**

My professor for my 400 level community health class is treating it like it's rocket science and trying to make us all miserable. And before people assume he's a crotchety old man-- nope he's like 30.

He is the only person who teaches this class, so I'm stuck with him. With the class being partly virtual, he's only gotten more bitter and horrible. You can read some of the quotes

Last semester, I feel a bit embarrassed to admit it, but I was very intimidated by him. I made excuses for his behavior because ""oh.. well, he IS the professor..."" and ""he DOES have his doctorate.. and I don't... so I should just shut up.""

Today, I started writing down what he was saying, because I'm done making excuses for his behavior. **I should be clear I was writing this down in a frenzy and tried to get it verbatim. I'm not going to pretend it's 100% accurate, but just know I got key phrases down.**

I mean maybe I'm going crazy but isn't his behavior a bit unprofessional?

Basically he told us all we were unintelligent, was really creepy about watching us on our webcams, said things that were patently false, and came off as a truly horrible person. I didn't mention this in the main post but he also was really rude to this one boy with a stutter for saying that his introduction to the class was ""taking too long"" when we were doing icebreakers, and got annoyed at another girl for having herself muted on accident. She looked like she wanted to cry.

Honestly this was way too long and I probably spent more time thinking about this than I should, so congrats Professor A, you won. You got in my head. I hope you have a good night drinking the blood of children. And I hope everyone reading this at least laughed at it or got something out of it.",20,3,whyiscollegelikethis

I took that class in March of 2020 and had to move out of the dorm and back home halfway through the semester. Every one of my other professors gave us a night off the usual blackboard posts because they knew it was move out day. I got an email from him the day I was moving out that said ""I know you would probably all enjoy a break, but think of this as a practice in motivation and discipline. I will expect your assignments by midnight."" I don't think I need to say more about that.

I swear to god this man hates teaching. For context, he is teaching a course that deals with Community Health and wellness planning. It's not rocket science, but today he made it incredibly clear to everyone he is going to make this PAINFUL for us. 

I just finished our first zoom class-- which, by the way, started with him pointing out that he is in the classroom teaching a section of the class in person and that we ""cant live in our bubbles forever"". He then said ""I have my doctorate, so I can tell you all about why isolating can actually create consequences, but that's for another day."" Excuse me WHAT? That's when I pulled up a word document on the side and started writing down the insane shit he was saying because if I don't, I'll just tell myself down the line that I'm being unfair to him or that he ""really isn't THAT bad"", like I did last time. 

So here is some of that.

Did you understand the concepts? If so, then good. Move on. Who gives a shit what arbitrary letter this professor feels like giving you? 

""copying what a source said verbatim is not permitted in this course. you can put quotes around it and cite the source and explain it, but it's still copying, and this is a 400 level course so I expect for you to be able to refrain from this."" 

\&gt;I... what? But he kept going: 

""You need to add something to the field of study. If you're writing a paper and your paper is just a dry explanation of the material and how well you understand it, that's not going to cut it. I want you to make bold claims and back them up. Because when you make those claims, it gives us a chance to prove them false, which is a very important skill."" 

\&gt; I think I kind of understand what he maybe was getting at in the first half, but not the second part. I think he meant to say ""I want you to sound stupid in your papers so I can say that you're stupid""

He expanded upon this for another TEN MINUTES at which point he said this: 

""Its okay to disagree with me. I value it. I enjoy when students try to disagree. I welcome hearing your perspectives. At the end of the day, I will walk away from the argument knowing I'm right, and you've just made my argument stronger by pointing out all of the perceived weaknesses."" 

**This hyper-rationalist persona he's cramming down our throats is so fucking obnoxious. He's like the greasy incel alt-right kid you went to high school with who always butts in and is like ""well ACTUALLY,"" and ""let me tell you why you're wrong--""**

And don't get me fucking started on *RESPONDUS LOCKDOWN BROWSER WITH WEBCAM*. That shit is fucking disgraceful and the fact that colleges even allow that to be implemented is disturbing. 

My college has this policy on Respondus that basically says ""it's up to the professor, but most of our professors find this software unnecessary.""

Guess what? Professor A ""LOVES"" Respondus. He wrote a legitimate love letter to it in the syllabus, calling it ""eye-opening"" and ""revolutionary"". I'm not even joking. Here's what he said in class!

""I caught several students cheating using respondus lockdown browser last semester. It was suspected that they were looking things up on their phones. And yes, they did get penalized. **That's why I record your web cam feed during exams. I really take my time scrubbing through those videos looking for evidence that you are cheating.** I have to. If it looks to me like you are looking elsewhere in your room, or possibly cheating, I have to investigate that."" 

\&gt;Yeah, fuck cheating-- but seriously??? Gross. Fucking creepy. Offensive. I don't even know what to think anymore. I took upper level math last semester and my professor didn't bother with the webcam feature. And that was MATH-- arguably the class where students are going to want to cheat most.

And to close it out we have the most disturbing thing he said the whole two hours:

""I'm very good at telling when someone is lying and cheating. And those are two things that get on my nerves. I hate to say it but those things really tick me off. \[at this point he just paced at the front of the classroom nodding solemnly and it was so cringe\] And I am well within my rights to get angry. If I think that you're cheating, there really isn't anything you can do to convince me otherwise, because I'm usually right. A lot of students get upset about that. But I'm well within my rights."" 

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR**

My professor for my 400 level community health class is treating it like it's rocket science and trying to make us all miserable. And before people assume he's a crotchety old man-- nope he's like 30. 

He is the only person who teaches this class, so I'm stuck with him. With the class being partly virtual, he's only gotten more bitter and horrible. You can read some of the quotes  

Last semester, I feel a bit embarrassed to admit it, but I was very intimidated by him. I made excuses for his behavior because ""oh.. well, he IS the professor..."" and ""he DOES have his doctorate.. and I don't... so I should just shut up."" 

Today, I started writing down what he was saying, because I'm done making excuses for his behavior. **I should be clear I was writing this down in a frenzy and tried to get it verbatim. I'm not going to pretend it's 100% accurate, but just know I got key phrases down.**

I mean maybe I'm going crazy but isn't his behavior a bit unprofessional? 

I wanna send him an email telling him exactly what I think of him but I obviously can't. I want to fuck with him or subtly tell him off in a way where I won't get in trouble lol, but I can't think of any ways to do this. 

**How the fuck am I going to survive this?** I want to get a good grade because it's one of my final major classes but honestly since he has it out for us what's the fucking point. I hate professors like this with a passion. 

Honestly this was way too long and I probably spent more time thinking about this than I should, so congrats Professor A, you won. You got in my head. I hope you have a good night drinking the blood of children. And I hope everyone reading this at least laughed at it or got something out of it.",0,1,whyiscollegelikethis
409,lb6zi0,2021-02-02 21:29:25,CollegeRant,My professor is an elitist and arrogant POS and I have no idea how to get through this.,"I'm in the final stretch of college. One semester left. I've had some truly challenging classes over the years. I was in Nursing for two years and then switched over to Health Education because I want to get into health policy eventually. I am not a genius, but trust me when I say I know how to work hard. I've made deans list every semester for two years straight. And yet, this professor openly admitted he is going to try to end that. 

Look I've had some shitty professors too. I've had some downright mean ones. Normally I just keep my head down, do the work, roll my eyes, and then I get a passing grade. But this one? Oh man he makes me so angry I don't know what to do. 

Lets call him Professor A. I've had professor A before for a course, but it was online. And he was absolutely a dickhead back then, but it was tolerable since it was online. 

Although, I have to say I should have known he was going to be a shithead when he assigned us homework that was just to listen to four 2 hour and 30 minute Sam Harris podcasts and ""explain why he's right"".... 

I took that class in March of 2020 and had to move out of the dorm and back home halfway through the semester. Every one of my other professors gave us a night off the usual blackboard posts because they knew it was move out day. I got an email from him the day I was moving out that said ""I know you would probably all enjoy a break, but think of this as a practice in motivation and discipline. I will expect your assignments by midnight."" I don't think I need to say more about that.

I swear to god this man hates teaching. For context, he is teaching a course that deals with Community Health and wellness planning. It's not rocket science, but today he made it incredibly clear to everyone he is going to make this PAINFUL for us. 

I just finished our first zoom class-- which, by the way, started with him pointing out that he is in the classroom teaching a section of the class in person and that we ""cant live in our bubbles forever"". He then said ""I have my doctorate, so I can tell you all about why isolating can actually create consequences, but that's for another day."" Excuse me WHAT? That's when I pulled up a word document on the side and started writing down the insane shit he was saying because if I don't, I'll just tell myself down the line that I'm being unfair to him or that he ""really isn't THAT bad"", like I did last time. 

So here is some of that. 

""I want all my students to be successful. And I will determine if you are successful based off the intelligence you exhibit. If you can prove to me that you are intelligent, you might do decent in this class."" 

\&gt; Really. Reducing every one of us down to fit into the category of ""intelligent"" or ""not intelligent"" based on your arbitrary standards. Nice. What a great teacher you are. 

""Do any of you know what the difference between an A student and a B student is? Every semester I have a student email me upset because they must get an A-, and right now they're at a B. So I get to sit them down and have this conversation. I say to them-- you tell me, what does an A student look like? Does it look like someone who fails to turn in work and makes excuses? No. Do you think you *deserve* an A? \[....\] **When someone gets a B in my class it is because they were too lazy or too unintelligent to get an A. And I believe you all have the capacity to be intelligent, so my expectations are that you will all get an A. And if not, well, you just have to live with that**."" 

\&gt; Holy. Fucking. Shit. As someone who's made Deans List with a couple B grades, this is the most toxic shit I've ever heard. Getting a B or even a B- is literally fine.

411,l9qbfu,2021-02-01 00:33:13,CollegeRant,I'm starting to regret going back to school.,"So last year due to covet I love my job and after a summer of sitting on my ass I decided to go back to school. My first semester went great and I even made the Dean's list but this one is off to a abysmal start. My intro-business class is an online course so I assumed that when the semester started we have a little breathing room, at least until Friday we started on a Tuesday, before the first assignment were due. I was wrong and missed out on 40 points cause one was due on the first day of class and the other the second. I gritted my teeth and took it as a lose went over the  schedule to try to prevent that from happening again. My professor assigned us 'personal journals' that we are meant to reflect over chapters on how they can apply to our lives but as an unemployed guy with a work history dealing with manual labor and nothing remotely close to what the material is covering its hard for me to connect to the material outside of just regurgitating the information learned. Also we have weekly discussion post but aren't allowed to make more than one post a day with a minimum of 2 on someone else post. I don't know it seems that some of these restrictions are unnecessary and doesn't help to facilitate learning. I'm going to keep trying but it just seem like it's not going to end well.",14,4,JonahxHall
412,l9dsq1,2021-01-31 14:56:35,CollegeRant,i’m a junior in college and i’m really going to have to snitch for no one doing anything on a semester long group project,"firstly, it is important to note my entire semester is online and this class is also completely online. this is also the —checks calendar— the sixth day of the semester. 

my class does a project that lasts an entire semester. each week, we have challenges due—the first being tomorrow at noon. these challenges include a paper and a narrated powerpoint. they effect other groups because they have to use our presentations to complete with us in a march madness style bracket (among other things). when i say one singular presentation effects everyone, i mean *it effects literally every single person in this class*. 

it’s been rocky from the start. one of the group members decided to sign us up for a meeting without telling anyone or seeing if anyone was even available. while this is more of a lack of common sense/decency, i knew from this point that this was going to be a rough start. another lives in a country with a lot of censorship (my school has a large international presence) so we can only communicate via email as opposed to a group chat. i could careless that they aren’t in the main group chat (it’s not like i’ve been getting responses anyway). however, they don’t check their email and the time zone difference (13 hours, i believe) does throw a lot off. 

many texts have gone unanswered—even ones asking questions. i’ve offered ideas, asked opinions, asked about availability for the next meetings, you name it. i literally sound like a nagging wife trying to get any kind of crumb. out of everything we need to do for tomorrow, only about 10% is remotely figured out because no one is around to help me.

since tuesday night, i haven’t heard from two of the members. i’ve only received three texts, all yesterday and all barely helpful, from the other member. it’s clear they didn’t read the instructions because i had to rework everything they said to fit what we’re meant to be doing. i have no idea how the other two members feel about it but if you think i care you’re sadly mistaken. 

as for our next meeting? i took a lovely page out of my amazing group members book and i signed us up for a time that worked for me since no one else had anything to offer. 

i have my own shit to deal with on top of other classes. there’s absolutely no excuse for any of this. if you leave your group members hanging like this, you deserve a special place in hell—especially when 3 out of 4 members are doing it. at least let people know you’re going to slack off. just because it looks like i handle doing an entire challenge/project doesn’t mean you should do this or that i can. i can barely keep my shit together because two of my pets are dying, i’m going through a friendship breakup of 7 years, i’m dealing with this unnecessary bullshit and taking 18 credit hours during a pandemic and online. that’s a tall order for anyone. 

so, yeah, i’m snitching because i can’t do this every week. i can hardly do it this week. i can’t wait around by the phone and hope to god someone decides to help me figure out what we’re going to do.

i will note, in my email to my professor, i will offer to do everything (more or less so he’d understand the severity of my distrust and lack of faith in them), but ultimately i will leave it up to him to tell me if he wants me to complete the entire challenge or if he wants to deal with it. 

i just. i honestly cannot believe i am in a class filled with juniors, seniors and graduate students and this is how we are going to behave. who does that? who actually does this shit during a time when everyone is struggling with being online for school among many other things. i thought this stopped happening in... third grade? 

it would be one thing if it was just one person who decided they weren’t going to participate. *but all three?* leaving me to be the only one to do any of this? nah. i’ve lost every ounce of respect for every single person in this group. like i said, at least have the damn decency to let people know if you’re busy or are simply just not going to do anything.

**update:**

so, good news (kinda lol). two group members did end up showing up in the documents. i did about 60% of the work, they did, well, the rest. i’m really not sure what the other contributed outside of talking to me (which is honestly a big step. 

the third member, on the other hand, didn’t come back until 8PM... when everything was nearly done. their excuse for being absent for multiple days? they “had something to do”. that’s it. they. had. something. to. do. 

i did email the professor around five. i waited about nine hours for them to do something. nothing was done by then so i did it. i have my professor a very basic explanation of what happened. then i basically told him i was only saying something because i genuinely believe  it will be a prevailing issue. even now, i still believe that. i told him i’ve handled it for now by setting a boundary with them. i explained that i let them know how much i would do and when i would stop. i’d be available for help but its not my responsibility to do everything. i remained gender neutral and didn’t tell on anyone specifically—which i am glad about since some at least kind of helped. nothing is forgiven because at the end of the day they still waited until today to make any sort of effort. i do appreciate they didn’t leave me hanging.",28,178,analieserae

414,l6yyxf,2021-01-28 15:03:57,CollegeRant,One of my professors is ignoring online-teaching guidelines from the department chair,"I had a great professor pre-pandemic for an art studio course, where we'd meet Monday, Wednesday, Friday for two hours. I excelled well in the class, even with the learning disabilities I have, but when we moved online last March things slowly started getting more difficult.

Background context:

Instead of Zooming MWF, we'd only Zoom for two hours on Mondays to critique - which did make sense, but then he'd assign work due on Thursdays, and punish students who sent it in late, or send out passive aggressive emails if multiple students were late. Reasonably, he'd give preference in critiques to students who submitted early, allowing them to present their pieces in the order they submitted, but he wouldn't limit how long those discussions went, so the people who submitted late had to stay logged into class after it already ended, and would get shorter critiques with less people present. As someone who requires accommodations, this made the experience miserable since I'd always be submitting it over the weekend, and then get short-changed on my critique session and have little to work with going forward. I wouldn't be punished with lower grades directly, but the quality of my work wouldn't be up to standard since I wouldn't get enough critique or directions of how to improve my work and spend the semester feeling lost as a result of him not managing class time properly, which then would cause my grades to be lower.

This continued into the fall semester, which started messing with other students who would have classes that would meet online 5 days a week but only assign projects due on the days they were scheduled for. Enough students complained about it in a departmental survey that the department mandated that their professors cannot assign work due on days/times they do not meet (as did multiple other departments).

**Current issues:**

This semester, he scheduled his class to only meet on Mondays for two hours, since that's when he'd critique, and students would anticipate the same deal of ""just submit the projects between Thursday-Sunday."" A week before class started, though, he sent out an email telling students that he miscalculated how much work he was assigning and they'd have to come in on Wednesdays or Fridays. He gave them two responses they could send him ""I can do that!"" or ""That's great, I'm looking forward to seeing you twice a week,"" and even made a joking comment about how they should notice that he didn't include no as an option. His class is still only officially scheduled for Mondays, so right now he's in violation of guidelines the chair of the department gave their professors if he's requiring students to Zoom on days they aren't scheduled.

At that point I had to drop the course, since I had already scheduled my classes and therapy around the fact that I'd only be meeting in his class on Mondays. I'm thinking of bringing it up with the Student Government, since the chair of the art department doesn't step in in regards to anything (not even requests for students to sign up for majors in the department). I'd feel a bit like a spiteful jerk, though, since I've already dropped the class and I'm not being directly affected by it, and I have no idea how his other students feel, or if he's since changed his mind in the week since he made that decision.

Should I just mind my own business or is this something I should report to the Student Government, since they take these issues quite seriously and advocate for students? Either way, I think his students will have an unpleasant experience of either having to readjust their class/job schedule to fit in his extra class periods that he's not allowed to schedule, and if this does cause some sort of change in his class, then the students who were available (and everyone else) will have either a larger workload due on Mondays only and/or less opportunities to have their work reviewed without the extra mandatory meetings.",3,1,AdmireableOven
415,l4wgpp,2021-01-25 20:16:43,CollegeRant,Professors should answer emails on the weekends.,"This semester my professors have all adopted a policy that if you send them an email on friday after 5 p.m. they will not reply to you until some time in the morning on Monday. Seeing as we’re in a global pandemic, main communication between students and professors is online, and they’re overwhelming us with insane amounts of work answering emails over the weekend is the BARE MINIMUM.

All of this schoolwork they’re loading onto us has us working 7 days a week, day and night. We have no choice but to dedicate our entire weekends to their classes and their schoolwork because they think that just because we’re in our homes we have more time (yeah not the case...some of us work). They also seem to think that we only take their class (and when they don’t they go ahead and assign ridiculous amounts of work anyway) but that’s a rant for another day. That being said, I just feel like this email policy is stupid. If our main mode of communication is email, and students are working on your schoolwork during the weekends the LEAST you can do is answer emails on the weekends as well.

I have two classes labeled as “Online”, however, I just found out they have optional Zoom meetings and one of them almost overlaps with a “Canvas” class. I understand that the Zoom meetings are optional for the “Online” classes, but I wished that it was labeled as “Canvas” instead before I registered. I get that it’s not a big deal, who cares if I leave 5-10 minutes early or don’t even bother attending that class, but it’s nice to know this information beforehand, ya know :/

422,l25h6p,2021-01-21 19:18:48,CollegeRant,A Commuter's Rant,"Hi guys, new here because I really need to vent.

I'm a senior, graduating this May and have yet to have a true college experience and I have a lot of feelings right now.

Long story short, I went to a cheap college (mostly online) for my first two years to knock core classes out and then transferred to a bigger university. First year (sophomore), I stayed in a dorm and made tons of friends through that and my campus job. 

I lived in an off-campus apartment the next semester, couldn't get parking, and had a hard time getting involved on campus.

After that, things got rocky and I had to move back home (an hour away) which wasn't a huge deal because covid moved things online. 

This semester, I have 7 classes and 5 are on campus. I have to wake up at 5:30 to make it to my first class and stay on campus until after 6 before my last class is over. I haven't spoken to any of my friends, I had to give up my campus job, I'm not involved in any clubs, and I just feel so isolated. It's stupid and I hate it and I miss my friends.

Not to mention the 2 hour drive to campus and back sucks big time. Every. Freakin. Day. It's wasted time I could spend on work or friends if I was closer to campus.

I can't afford to live on campus as I'm paying my own way through college but I feel so cheated of the classic college experience. I'm so frustrated I just feel like crying.

My dad told me to suck it up because he commutes to work but he doesn't have to come home and do hours worth of homework like I do. I told him I can't be involved in ANY of the groups I used to be involved in and he simply does not care.

Anyone else having a similar experience? I could really use advice or support.",2,1,manykitty1

424,l1fws2,2021-01-20 19:03:24,CollegeRant,I have no idea why I'm still in college,"I'm in my third year of college and I haven't been looking forward to this semester. The reason being is that the previous semester didn't go well for me. I had to drop a course as well as barely scraping by the rest of my courses. The classes I'm taking right now will be much more difficult than last time and retaking the class I dropped last time isn't going to make things any better. It feels very weird retaking a course, I never thought this was ever going to happen to me at all.

I'm also not feeling any motivation whatsoever because I'm not enjoying my major at all, but it's too late to change my major now. The major I'm doing right now will not lead me anywhere in the future either.

I'm already behind in credits and I have to take summer courses to become a senior the upcoming school year. I initially planned for 18 credits this semester but the fact that I had to drop a course last semester (from 15 to 12 credits), I decided not to overload with 18 credits this semester.

I can't focus on studying very well. I've been taking notes, doing my homework, been trying to pay attention to my professors, go to offices, checked YouTube videos online, but nothing is working for me. My Internet is slow as well, there's nothing I can do about it. 

My GPA doesn't keep improving either, it just literally stays the same. It's currently a 3.03, with the last two semesters being exactly 3.0. I'm having the feeling that this semester could get worse for me, which could make my GPA become lower than a 3.0, to the point where I won't be able to afford for college anymore.

At this point, I have no clue what I'm actually doing in college anymore. I'm just feeling like I've been sacrificing myself in college since day 1. I don't get how most people think it's easier than high school, it makes no sense to me. I don't think college/university was ever for me, to be honest. It was never a place I wanted to go anyways. It's literally making me miserable right now.

**TL;DR** \- Third year, pessimistic about the semester, lack of care and motivation, not enjoying my major, issues with credits towards graduation, poor studying habits, concerned about college GPA and money in the future, doubting college is for me.",20,1,-Sky_Nova_20-

Our college uses Canvas for classroom &amp; course management.  It's a beautiful software from what I've seen.  Easy to work with, versatile, and built for the modern web.

Out of every college professor that is teaching during a semester, it seems that 2/10 of them don't use Canvas at all.  You can't message your professor, you have to email them.  You can't see your grades, you either have to pray their high or wait for the monthly reports.  There's no online syllabus to reference, nor is there a schedule for classes.  You have to use what's given to you in order to know what's happening.

I retook both classes over 2 summer semesters.  My 1st English class had no communication whatsoever, and I was practically used to it since it was my first semester, but I retook it 2 semesters later and it was incredible.  The next class was science.  I took earth science, and while the professor put a schedule online, he changed things on a daily basis to the point where you could have an assignment due 2 weeks later, then have it changed to that weekend in minutes.  I got so behind and was forced to withdraw.  I took meteorology (general science credit) this past summer and made a high B.

Thankfully, those days are over.  My remaining classes will all be taught by the same professor, who thoroughly enjoys Canvas and updates things quickly but with plenty of notice.",1,1,gl3nnjamin

428,l0cxx1,2021-01-19 05:15:38,CollegeRant,Conflicted feelings about online classes,"Hey everyone,

I hope everyone is doing as best as they can through these tough times.

There’s not much of a purpose for this post, just some stuff I wanna get off my chest.

So I’m about to start my second semester of online classes at home. I have a pretty good home life, but I’m getting kind of sick at being at home. My mom is kinda controlling and I feel like I’m not able to be as independent as I want to be. I have sibling who gets to live with her friends in an apartment (some in person classes), and as more time passes by, the more envious I am :(

Here’s the thing though, I don’t really mind online classes. It’s nice have more time outside of class to get shit done and being able to speed through recordings is awesome. I’m also a homebody...

I like spending time with my family, but I think what like more is just having people that I’m comfortable with just being near me, even if we aren’t talking.

I want to go back in person, but at the same time, I don’t. I wish I leaned more one way than the other, but damn, it’s hard.

I don’t have a solid group of friends (I wish I did), but I do have a few really great friends. 

I feel like I’m always pressured to say things like, “I can’t wait to go back on campus” and “I miss dorming” when in reality, I just don’t. 

I don’t really feel lonely at home, which is great. But I don’t want to be stuck here. I know I need to get out and leave once classes go back in person. But the thought of that doesn’t really make me feel excited. 

The pressure of having a bigger social life from people around me stresses the shit out of me, they make me feel abnormal. 

I’m scared for my social life after college (junior now). I love talking to people, but scared of the lack of opportunities. 

I’ve experienced loneliness a couple times in college (when I lived on-campus) and damn, it’s one of the worst feelings, for me at least.

Anyways, if you’ve read this far, thanks and good luck. We will get through this!",0,1,Purple__turtle5737

But zoom and online classes terrify me, and I have had panic attacks in class during and after speaking. In my experience when telling a teacher I have social anxiety and panic attacks they are either very kind and accommodating, or they call and pick on me constantly because they belive that I’m just timid and that forcing me to speak and putting pressure on me will magically solve these issues. I’m also a freshman in college, so in high school i had Known these teachers or were able to tell them in person . I’m honestly even wondering if I should tell them because of this, and because I don’t want a teacher to get the impression that I’m not a hard worker or am trying to take the easy way out.

430,kzohpa,2021-01-18 05:55:14,CollegeRant,Fuck group assignment,"Why is this shit a thing? Last semester, i carried my group members and aced 2 group assignments. I did almost 75% of the stuff all by myself. And yes i did ask them nicely to cooperate, when i do, they would just add one or two new sentences and sent the document back to me and call it a day. With online class its even more hard to work together. Im seriously sick of it when someone gets their undeserved credit when i do almost all the stuff. 

I know when you start to work, they will be time you need to work in group. Tell you what,  i worked a couple years before i join college. And i have never experience this frustration when working in groups, someone refuses to cooperate? Call the manager and everything will be set, even funny is that some will get fired and you get to do everything and get every credit for it. I complaint to my teacher and she said its my duty to convince them to cooperate. Excuse me? There is no leader in the group, everyone is equal, despite that i did tell them to improve their shit and yet got ignored most of the time. 

Before everything started, i asked my teacher can i do it solo? You know what she said? ""Do it in group or zero mark"". I predicted all these shit will happen so i volunteered to work alone but got rejected AND those shit actually happened. FUCK IM SO MAD.

I was trying to figure out why I was struggling so much... and after instead of watching the professor's videos to learn, I went to khan academy and the book that he gave us, and just decided to use those.... and to put things into perspective.... It took me a full day to do one homework in that class compared to 2 hours just using the book and khan academy...

So god dang professors need to get to the point when making their videos and their handwriting needs to improve as well... I am taking a music theory class, and holy cow... his videos are VERY professional.... he has a black background, draws on a holographic whiteboard, and he has a built-in microphone he wears on his shirt...  and I was wondering how he got all his fancy equipment... I found out that our campus has a place for professors to record their videos, and this bothers me as some of the professors refuse to utilize it even though it is easier to understand for students AND it actually makes the course so much more interesting... I get it, COVID and crap... but hearing and researching a little more, they have hired people cleaning the stations 24/7 to make it safer for them.... so come on now... what a time to live in....",0,1,ThrowRA-Lost-
432,kyhghl,2021-01-16 11:37:00,CollegeRant,Online Engineering Course Woes,"I'm taking this engineering course centered around a device design project and it is online this semester. It's asynchronous (so no class meetings). I wish I could wait for it to be in person but I need to take it now.

We have until next week to form our own groups out of 100+ students. I don't know these people! Plus, the professor just copy-pasted everything from last semester's class which was also online and didn't change the word 'fall' to 'spring' on 99% of it.

I took a shot in the dark and emailed some students who work at the same place as me. They should recognize my name at least and I gave them a little intro about me.

I haven't had a response back from anyone.

It's hard enough to put myself out there and reach out to people but I'm a ball of social stress because too many students just don't reply to emails. At least let me know if you saw it!

It's frustrating. 

I'm a female minority in the south (U.S.).  I don't want to be PLACED into a group by the professor and end up with a group where everyone else knows each other and treats me like an outsider (This has happened before and one guy wouldn't even make eye contact or entertain my suggestions). 

Building connections is friggin hard when you don't relate to people and they don't relate to you, particularly those dude-bro guys who grew up fixing cars with their dads and think they know everything because they have a 3d printer and a garage of tools. I just didn't grow up like that and a lot of guys in this area did.

My research project was also canceled last summer and I'm stressed about gaining experience without sacrificing COVID precautions. Let me tell you, these old white men here, who I call professors and potential employers, do not care.

433,kxi9g6,2021-01-15 00:00:06,CollegeRant,How My Hatred of the College System Ruined My Life,"I went to an obnoxious preppy high school that was pretty intense. Most students were gunning very hard to get into the best schools they possibly could get into, stressing out about grades, test scores, and ridiculous extracurriculars that they didn't give a shit about. I hated the cynicism around everything to do with college and choose to have no part in any of it. I didn't study for any standardized tests, ignored bullshit classwork, didn't take any AP classes just to try to impress colleges, and spent my free time the way I wanted to (did some extracurriculars but only stuff I would have done anyway even if it didn't count for college). I ended my four years with a weak GPA which was a mix of Bs and Cs since I ignored so much of my assigned work and surprisingly strong standardized test scores (more than enough for all but the very best schools).

&amp;#x200B;

I had a very immature and stupid attitude towards school at the time and I should have just sucked it up because I left myself in an even worse place because of it. As a result of my awful grades, I had very few options for colleges to go to and I refused to go to community college because of the stigma around it. The college I went up at was even worse than high school both in terms of the quality of the teaching and the cynicism of the students. I was around a lot of rich kids who flaunted their wealth for no good reason and loads of international Chinese kids who had no academic ethics at all and would collude to cheat in all their classes. The most serious students who weren't just complete idiots were all incredibly driven by that sweet dollar green and had very little passion for what they were actually doing. Being in this college environment made me feel very depressed and alienated to the point where I felt so shitty that I couldn't even leave my room because I felt like there was literally no one there I could actually relate to and enjoy spending time with (I WAS socializing but it always felt incredibly empty). This was when I failed my first semester of school.

&amp;#x200B;

Next, I decided that I needed to get out of that space since it was so horrible for me. I enrolled in my local community college and started taking classes which a general inclination towards liberal arts. It was hard to accept at first since I know that all the people from my old high school would look down on me for it but I sucked it up. I was working hard but it was still a depressing environment to be in with very little meaningful social interaction available for students (no clubs outside of stuff catering towards different ethnicities of students). I didn't mind the cynicism that students had since they were in a more precarious financial position and trying to move out of being working class or lower middle class as opposed to already being well off.  I was surprised to find that between my high school, four-year college, and community college that the highest concentration of genuinely passionate students was at the community college (this is still only my experience of three schools). I meet a couple of kids in my physics classes who in a more just world would have been going to top STEM universities but since they were minority students in underprivileged neighborhoods (Black and Latino students both without any resources or support at their disposal) were stuck at this mediocre CC with me.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually, I was able to find my footing at CC but I feel like it is too little too late. I'm 22 now and I have only really made a year's worth of progress since I kept on changing my mind on what I was going to study. I was struggling so much to keep it together last semester during online classes (because of covid) and I couldn't do it. I failed another semester of classes because I couldn't keep my head straight, I already felt so socially alienated at CC, but when I literally couldn't even interact with other students or my professor that just took it to a whole new level of feeling alienated.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if I could have avoided all this if I had better guidance and sucking it up in high school or if this was inevitable. I can't spend too much time looking back at the past now, I just wish I could get myself out of this death spiral that I'm in where I have no direction with very few prospects for meaningful work that I could be doing. I wasted so much time that I could have spent doing other things that would have helped me more and I can't even say that I wasted the time having fun (I was miserable most of the time). I could have been working or finished my degree already if I wasn't such a stubborn bonehead. I know that technically I can still finish my degree, and technically it isn't over for me, but that doesn't change that I really fucked myself over. The time I lost equates to literally hundreds of thousands of dollars of unearned wages in that same time (even though that has never been my focus) I could be working and significantly decreased career potential for when I actually finish school (harder to move up and land the kinds of jobs I want) since I'll be four to five years behind a student who completed on time (or a year early). It's so hard to see that and not just give up on the spot.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: Immature in high school and wasn't willing to put up with college prep stuff I didn't like which hurt my prospects a lot. Went to a university that I had a bad experience at. Went to community college and sorta found my footing but now it feels like I'm way too far behind.",4,1,frustratedtempacc
434,kvuhjx,2021-01-12 16:06:37,CollegeRant,"Really fucked myself over this time, going to miss a deadline and lose 5% on a module; the uni throwing curveballs isn't helping...","So I was always a good student til now - or at least, just managed to get by with overall good grades. However this semester entirely online with no in-person contact has been a shitshow for me to put it lightly, I've never felt so terrible. 

I went back to uni in Oct hoping we'd have *something* in person like they insinuated, but nothing, so was just stuck in my room all day, especially during the further lockdowns. Then they urged us to move home for holidays weeks before the end of term, and now also to not come back (term started again last week) until the end of Feb at the earliest cause of more severe lockdown (I'll probably just do the rest of the uni year from home, only going back to pick up my stuff, but that's another story), and we're having online exams, the format of which was completely unknown til just recently. Thankfully my coursework and class tests I had while at uni (where my mental health was awful, stuck in my room all day) went alright overall, though they were only minor things. 

Anyway I have 3 big exams next week (each worth at least 50% of their modules, that's what we call classes here) and a deadline for a huge project worth 50% of its module. I haven't started studying or working on the project at all and feel absolutely fucked. Technically the next 2 weeks are our exam weeks, but they decided to stick all our exams on the first week, the 2 biggest on the first two days back to back.

What's really pissed me off is that they told us we had a window from next Friday til the following Monday to do the last 2 hour online exam, so I was hoping to cram on the weekend and Monday and do the exam them. But literally just this afternoon they suddenly backtracked and said we only have from Friday til Saturday (exam on a weekend, what?), so my previous plans go out the window.

I've had to adjust my study/work schedule to be working 10 hour days, including weekends, from tomorrow til Monday after next... but it's still not enough time to get everything done on time. My project's due next Friday, I'm planning to submit it 3 days later on the Monday, which'll be -10% as it's only one working day later. However that'll be an automatic -5% in the module overall, which is one of only three graded this semester, so'll bring down my average. 

I know it's not the end of the world and benign compared to a lot of the problems on this sub, but as someone who's always managed alright and never missed a big deadline, it's just really disheartening to know that even if I work flat-out for the next couple weeks I'm gonna have 5% knocked off (and that's best case scenario that my exams and the project itself don't go awfully). 

I know I dug my grave here but it's just been a really rough semester; between moving back to uni, locked down with everything online, having to suddenly move home, being locked down even more severely here with everyone stuck in the house, and being hit with these big exams and deadlines right after the holidays... hasn't helped my ol depression and anxiety to say the least.

I feel so guilty and terrible like I've let my family and everyone down, cause they've given me plenty of time and opportunity to work, and I just haven't taken it, and fucked myself over... I can only blame myself for this royal mess of a situation. I barely slept last night cause I was so anxious about everything, and I'm just so stressed and feeling awful at the moment. Not to sound like a wuss but I was crying earlier today and trying to fight back the tears whilst playing outside with my little siblings (who are both having to do school online at the moment because of the lockdown).

I just had to vent somewhere, if you read this far thank you for reading, and I hope whatever situation you're in you're doing okay. Honestly I urge people to prioritise their mental health over school, grades are not the end of the world, and I think things will work out in the end. x",0,1,anonuser23590

I did not do well in the Fall semester at all tbh. Covid, online classes, poor internet, and poor mental health can really beat the shit out of you. 

Found out that since I broke a contract, if I wanted to continue we would have to pay over $5,000 just to attend for a semester. Being lower middle class of course we were like “Fuck that” and decided it was best for me to take a semester off for mental health reasons. 

Earlier in the semester financial aid refused to pay for my parking even though they did previous years and it did not show up online. So I found out the hard way I had to pull $400 out of my ass. But luckily, since I am no longer going to attend all I need to pay is $400 for my transcripts, right?

Yea...no. I received an email about a week or so after I withdrew from the school saying I have to pay $500 worth of textbooks since I did not return them, and if I do happen to return them, the price will be halved.

I emailed those fuckers telling them I could not mail my books back or physically return them because I tested POSITIVE FOR COVID!! If I knew they wanted Rona covered books so bad I should have shown up.

It really does baffle me how they can change a class’s format so late and expect everyone to adapt. Because I never secured housing, I’d have to either miraculously find living conditions  or do a 4 hour commute each day the class is in session.

439,kuknhf,2021-01-10 19:14:22,CollegeRant,I feel like I need a break...,"I bet that title speaks for a lot of us, am I right? 

Anyway, I’m a 24F studying undergrad in hopes to apply for veterinary school in the 2022 application cycle. I’ve been in college since I graduated high school, barely taking breaks, not even in the summer (mostly). I’ve come to getting very close to being able to apply to vet school with only 7/8 classes left. However I’ve come across a dilemma.

I’m not sure what it is, but I’ve been burnt out for almost a year, coincidentally since Covid started hitting us and I had to transition to online schooling. The first semester I was at home was great because I was laid off (Temporarily) and could devote most of my time to class work. I actually ended up making the Dean’s list that semester. But after I started going back to work we were hit by a lot of things. We had to train a new manager after our old one left, we were working with our shelter at full capacity almost constantly (I work at an animal shelter) we had a lot of what we call “behavior cases” to work on (a behavior case is a dog or cat that has certain behavior problems like hard mouthing, chewing on leash, a ton of energy that needs expelled, etc.) and I was struggling. I stumbled through that semester and failed. This last fall semester I tried but broke even, getting a C in the class. 

I’m not sure what it is about it but I think it’s the combination of school being online, being stressed about Covid and outside life stuff that’s getting to me. 

A few days ago, I called into work sick. I had a throbbing migraine and could barely focus. I still had a headache the next day so I got nervous and scheduled a Covid test. My grandma had the genius idea that maybe I should check my blood pressure since she had a migraine related to hers not too long ago. Turns out, my blood pressure was almost dangerously high. If I remember correctly it was 166/98? Normal range is about 130/80. This really worried my mom and grandma (as well as myself) and I scheduled a doctors appointment to get a full physical. 

My grandma said that I’ve been stressing myself out lately and that maybe I should consider taking a break. But I don’t want to take a break because in 2 semesters I can apply to vet school. It’s what I’ve wanted so badly. And it’s almost there. But my health is also important and I can see why my mom and grandma would say that. I do feel stressed and for the first time in a while I’m not excited about starting classes. I feel tired. Maybe I could try B Term? Or just go summer and fall. 

What do you guys think? Any of you ever been in this situation before? Thanks in advanced.",6,1,WhyY_196

441,kthbhz,2021-01-09 01:55:01,CollegeRant,My first semester of college made me feel like shit (Long rant),"After putting up with so much crap in my senior year of HS, I was truly expecting college to be the time I would be able to change. I expected my college experience to be better, I'd make a couple friends, choose what major I wanted to pursue, find a job to make some money on the side, and looking back at it now, I realize how DREADFULLY naive I was to think I would enjoy college.

2020 happened, and with it came Covid-19, which forced my college to put us into online classes through Zoom. I already struggle enough to stay focused in a class in-person, and Zoom meetings made this problem worse. This also meant I had no classmates to be around with. I have no friends at all, I am a very shy, antisocial person, and needless to say, being forced to be stuck in my room during classes did not do anything to help me.

I was pressured by my parents to start my own business as a screenprinter. It failed because I lost the patience to put up with it since countless mistakes kept coming up, I barely had any requests coming in, and almost all the money I received had to be spent buying more materials. Plus, I had no passion for this job. This left me completely burned out, and it might have affected my college performance at the end.

The worst part came with the schoolwork. Having five classes to take, I was doing pretty well with all of them, consistently earning good grades. But towards the end of October, I completely crashed. Family and personal problems started to be an issue, it was impossible for me to stay organized because things kept coming up out of nowhere and took away the time I had, my mental health weakened and demotivated me from doing anything productive, even if it was important, and I struggled to understand parts of my assignments, and with all the stress I had on me, I felt it was easier to not do the assignment at all rather than spend hours trying to study and figure out what to do.

This reflected BADLY on my grades. I failed all but one of my classes, with the highest grade I made being a C. My GPA tanked, and my college put me into academic suspension. Thankfully, they're willing to give me a second chance, I am allowed to come back this upcoming semester, and I am still allowed to receive financial aid to pay for my education, but this time it is clear that I must improve my GPA and pass all my classes. To this day, though, I barely have the willpower to keep going through with college, and I have to try my best to keep news about failing my semester away from my parents, because I know I will be in for an awful punishment, and they might even force me to change to a major that THEY want me to pursue. I will never be able to become independent from my family this way.

2020 has really made me hate college, and adult life in general. Things were bad in high school, but the problems got a thousand times worse now. I truly wish I could just drop out and leave my parents house at this point.

**tl;dr:** Screw the college life, it just makes you feel worse than when you were a teenager. I truly don't want to keep going with it, and I don't know what to do anymore. Sorry for the wall of text",11,1,Hydrakobold

My college's bookstore provides every student with a list of textbooks you need for each class, usually about a month prior to the start of every term. I bought my textbooks 2 weeks ago, and thought I was all good. My college has been recently publishing our courses on canvas, and what do you fuckin know, my new prof sends out a message on canvas introducing himself and giving us a different textbook.

I understand he's new to this course and has very little to go off of, hell he doesn't even have much of a syllabus ready since he's been thrown into this class so recently, it's just annoying I have to drop another $100 for an online rental textbook. I can't even return the online book I already got.

Hell this isn't even a class I need for my major, it's a geology course and I'm an art major. It's also an online class, so this will be fun.

I don't know why he doesn't use the textbook the bookstore says the class needs, there's probably a lot of valid reasons but im annoyed and this is a rant lmao (I haven't run into any problems like this in the past, and neither have anyone else in my family who have gone/go to this college), so cheers yall

After registering for all my classes, I clarified with my school that I’d be able to take them all remotely on top of them all already being listed as distance learning. I got the green light from for every class. And although one prof wasn’t going to allow distance learning, the class was listed as internet so it was already settled. Then what happens? That’s right, the class format changes to hybrid at the end of December, less than 30 days notice before the start of the semester, and now I’m being told I have to go back if I want to graduate. Oh and on top of all this, my school is starting the semester all online regardless. 

It’s utterly preposterous and downright unreasonable to expect students to be able to instantly adapt to a change as sudden as this, especially when the school is making it apparent that the course can be done online. So yeah, as of now it looks like I’ll be quitting my part time job and dropping thousands for housing/ meal plan.

447,kn9jtz,2020-12-30 20:01:41,CollegeRant,What did your professors do to help reduce student stress? (rant),"DISCLOSURE: I'm a professor.

A student called my dean saying I was overwhelming them with work. My class has always been hard, simply because my contracts stipulate I have to teach X amount of modules covering X subjects.  And there are just too many subjects.

But my students learn a lot.  Three months after taking my class one of my students got a job at HBO and worked on a big documentary that was just released.  He emailed me to let me know he wouldn't have gotten it without what he learned in my class.   It's pretty unusual for a kid to get a job at a big network with a Community College diploma.  Usually, you need a bachelor's. 

So I don't make my class hard because I want to be a bad-ass.  The class is just hard because A) I have to teach all the subjects I'm told to cover, and B) I want the students to really LEARN this shit!

But I know that everything is different with online learning, and all the other outside stuff that's adding additional stress.   So to accommodate that, I did the following.  


* eliminated the midterm exam
* had them turn in only part one out of the usual 2 parts of the midterm project
* let students turn in homework A MONTH LATE (with penalties of course)
* reduced the final project from 8 sections to 5 sections
* 86'd 3 lecture topics so we could go slower and spend more time on covered topics
* reduced homework assignments from 13 to 10.
* 3 of those assignments were just *""View these videos and show me your notes.""*  Literally.  Easy A.
* Upped my office hours from 3 hours a week to SEVEN hours a week.

Apparently, that wasn't enough.  Admin got the complaint and though they never would have had me change a thing if this were normal times

So I got a call from admin and agreed to their suggestions:

* eliminate the final exam
* let students hand in ANY missing homework.  That's a *16-week* late allowance.    


This means my students never had a single quiz or test during the final semester.  It also means the students that busted their ass are treated COMPLETELY UNFAIRLY!  They put in the work to get in everything on time, only to have me say *""Yeah, that doesn't matter because now I'm accepting everything. Sucks for you.""*

Not only is that -- to my mind -- doing a disservice to these kids, it also means I get walloped with a shit-ton of make-up assignments to grade during what is the busiest time of the semester.

The thing is, there's not one single in-person semester I've had where kids complained about the workload.  The class is VERY intense, but I've never had complaints.

Except for this semester:  the first fully online semester.

And the thing is, even my best students were stressed out.  They were overwhelmed. They were absolutely sweating.    A lot of my students have serious challenges.  Poverty, homelessness, horrible high schools, English as a second language, etc, etc.

Is there anything your professors did this semester that students said actually reduced stress?  I don't want my students to be paying for a class where they don't learn shit.  I want them to be able to get full scholarships to NYU like multiple of my previous students have.  I want my students to be able to graduate and get a job at HBO.  


I also want my students to learn time management because they won't be prepared for a career if they think they can just call the CEO and complain about their workload.

So is there anything your professors did that actually WORKED to reduce your stress?  I dunno, puppies?",7,1,emarcomd

I want to blame my grades on the situation and mental health but I feel so guilty I let myself ""slack off"". I came in with a lot of unresolved issues to campus, and I feel like I didn't give my university a fair shot which adds to the feeling of guilt. I transitioned to living on campus from my hometown which was not majority white, to living at a rural state school with a majority white population where I didn't feel like I connected to the culture and campus life at all. To keep my scholarship I had to be on campus. All of the rules and freshman events canceled it felt hard to meet others so I kept to myself and worked alone most of the time. 

This obviously did not work well as I got burnt out from working on my own and couldn't find a set group of friends; my college experience started to deteriorate to where I couldn't finish my work and couldn't perform daily tasks. When my school became remote, classes were at 3 AM and recorded.

I went to community college from Fall ‘15 to Spring ‘18. I have an Associate Degree in Liberal Arts (Arts and Letters Emphasis) and a Certificate in Communications. I transferred over to my local university in Fall ‘18 as a Linguistics Major. I ended up changing my major to Anthropology in Fall ‘19. I finally got my grades for the Fall semester today and I did average at best (in my opinion). Here they are as follows: A, A minus, D plus, and an F. 

I’m disappointed in myself and sometimes feel like I’m not cut out for college. I say this to myself every semester knowing well that I’m capable of earning A’s. I proved again that I can. Since they were all online classes, I struggled more than usual for some odd reason. I’ve taken online classes many times before, but I couldn’t get out of my own head. The two lower grades were from the same Professor. She had promised that she would curve the exams, but she never did because a majority passed them with at least C’s, leaving me hopeless. 

Another issue that I had with the classes where I earned low grades was that I had to use a webcam with Respondus lockdown browser. I don’t mind using Respondus lockdown browser itself because no Professor or student wants to deal with cases of cheating and stress about who is lying or telling the truth. Where I live with my family, they were always around me doing their own things as usual and it was impossible to leave to do my test anywhere else. Unfortunately, I was distracted by my surroundings and failed all of my exams for these two courses. Next semester will be my last and so I hope to graduate in the Spring of 2021. My classes will all be online again. I have to take another class with the Professor in which I earned low grades from. I just hope that she and other professors don’t require us to use webcams for exams because I’m not fortunate enough like many others to complete an exam in a quiet environment. I know I should’ve told her about my situation in the beginning of the semester and maybe she would’ve made accommodations for me.

In short, for this class at least, I was a chronic procrastinator. But I can at least say I turned in every project on the due dates, with varying quality mind you, but they were turned in.

Now, normally I would take it on the chin and accept that I didn't put in the amount of work I should have, and move on. But this is different. This semester has been terrible for me, and for most, if not all of my classmates. The school increased my tuition fee for a lesser class experience, and they're adding even more next semester. I want to apply to the school's BFA program in the spring, but I won't be able to if I fail this class, and then if I won't be able to apply, I'll have to wait over a year to try and get in again because they only take applications once a year. And that's just everything that's going on generally with the school.

 On to this class specifically. Again, it's an oil painting class, and before this semester I had never even touched a paint palette, much less paint with oils. Normally this would be fine because in a better world, I would be in the classroom with the teacher, able to show him my work and ask him how to do basic things like mix paint, apply medium, etc. But this is not a better world, so this time I had to try and make out what he was doing to a painting in a dimly lit classroom through a low resolution camera that was half out of frame. Couldn't even see his palette and what he was doing there either. So in short, I had to teach myself how to oil paint. And it did not go well. I looked up YouTube videos, I watched the recordings the professor put on our chat room, and I spent hours working on paintings that ended up looking like a 9 year old did them. They looked so bad, because I would spent most of my time on each project (which was 2-3 different paintings every 2 weeks) just trying to figure out what paints I needed, how to mix it, how to apply it, how to make it look like a cohesive illustration, and also figure out how fix any mistakes I made. (which were a lot, and it is NOT easy to fix) Because of this, I didn't receive a grade over 50% on any of the projects, which obviously is not good. I emailed this professor a couple times during the semester asking him about some specifics on what I could do better, because our ""critiques"" consisted of him just pulling up pictures of our paintings online and saying what was wrong about them, but not explaining how to fix what was wrong. Unfortunately, my emails got the same treatment. Some vague advice, tells me it's been hard for everyone, and maybe links an article that's 20 pages long that I had no desire to read. 

And that brings us to now. I look at my grade, see that I might fail the class, and thus mess up my whole college plan, as I've already registered for next semester, and I'm still waitlisted for a few of those classes, so there's no way I'd get into one this late. I email him one last time and explain everything that's been going on, learning how to do this online has been hard, oil painting is still completely foreign to me, I plan on being a digital artist primarily, so learning these traditional techniques has been especially hard, etc. I then ask him if there's anything I can do to just bring my grade up to passing, just so I can apply for the BFA in the spring.

Fast forward a day, and I get his response. He says that we're done and there's nothing I can do. He then goes on to write me a small essay (kind of like this post, hah) on how I just don't understand the importance of learning traditional drawing skills. He tells me that even though I have skills, a dream, and a goal, chances are I still won't make it to the career I want. From the tone of the writing I could tell he thought my skills are less than par. I could provide quotes, but this post is long enough. Essentially, he told me that chances are I won't succeed in my career and I should learn skills unrelated so I can ""adapt."" I feel like I should mention here that I am doing perfectly fine in all my other classes, B's and higher. Most of which are classes based solely around traditional mediums. So I don't think it's a matter of not knowing how to use traditional drawing methods. (also I don't understand how oil painting is even related to learning basic drawing techniques. Either I'm holding the brush wrong or it's a totally different thing.)

Needless to say, it both made me incredibly mad, and disheartened me a lot. It's not really the most inspiring thing when you're told you don't even have the basics down in your chosen craft, and you probably won't succeed because of that. 

So, long winded, but yeah. Sorry for the novel, I am kind of venting about this. And now, I don't know what to do. I've set up an appointment with my academic advisor next week, but I don't even know if they'll be able to help at all. Again, I am also at fault here.

TL;DR My professor isn't giving me a chance to save my grade, was somewhat condescending and demeaning to me, and now I might not pass and mess up my entire academic plan/career/life.

You're a real one if you made this far, so thanks for reading at the very least. Like I said,  I could totally be in the wrong here and just have to accept my fate. If so, sorry for wasting your time.",10,3,thatsmylyguy

Haven't even started it because I was working on 2 other papers due tomorrow.

459,kdvcep,2020-12-15 21:48:47,CollegeRant,"Losing my mind over a course elective, might need professional help after","Warning: This is a very long vent. 

To start: I wish I'd dropped this course when I had the chance. I never thought a college course would drive me so insane I'd actually have to seek out professional help. I never thought it would cause so much harm to my mental and physical health that'd I resort to drinking and self harm to get through the damn class. I attend art college and this particular course is animation. I'd also like to mention this class is an optional elective, not a program. It is available as a minor however and quite popular with students. Personally I took it for credit and as an elective to my major since courses were limited due to the pandemic. To say I'm absolutely horrific at animation would be an understatement. High expectations, overly passionate prof and heavy workload didn't help my case. 

Anyways, the semester ended and the professor is allowing for resubmits over the holiday. I am resubmitting two projects which weren't good enough. I am almost willing to take the Cs so I don't end up jumping off a building. The amount of hours I wasted on this class, the incoherent lectures, the contradictory critiques, redrawing frames over and over again till it meets minimum standards is so soul crushing. For an example, say you have to write a long thesis on your chosen topic relevant to the course material. BUT you can only use an old typewriter. Your professor keeps spotting all these mistakes and keeps saying it's not good enough. So he makes you rewrite it over and over again until it's perfect. With the addition of giving contradictory advice: Telling you to format it this way, change this, add this. Then the next time he tells you to remove all those things. One of my other professors kept calling the course a ""black hole"". Which is accurate in my case.

Halfway through the semester I ended up developing horrible anxiety over this course to the point of almost vomiting. The thought of having to jump online and join class made me literally sick. I also ended up with back and wrist pain from all the hours spent hunched over trying to get work done. I had issues falling asleep due to the discomfort of the pain. When I did sleep, I'd sometimes have these horribly embarassing animation dreams. This is where things went severely downhill. Due to the pandemic and being a full time student with 5 studio courses, I wasn't able to run to the pharmacy. I didn't have time to see a psychiatrist to get a prescription or see a therapist regularly. However, I was so desperate for an at-home-solution I ended up drinking a lot (these gross strong flavoured vodka and tequila beverages). I've never been a fan of alcohol and shouldn't drink it due to epilepsy but I couldn't find another coping mechanism that worked. Alcohol makes me sleepy so to avoid lashing out, panic attacks, overwhelming stress and anxiety I kept drinking. In the later half of the semester my other studio courses were getting tougher and I found myself increasingly frustrated with this chaotic class. One night after a one on one meet with the prof I chomped down hard on my right wrist. I was shocked I even did it, the teeth marks and swelling it left were really unappealing. I was exhausted having not slept for two days and on the verge of tears so I guess I was desperate to let some frustration out. I was pretty grossed out by the bite and had to clean it so I opted for a different method. Every time it would get to an unbearable point I would use a steak knife instead. Never enough to break skin or scar but just enough to relieve anger and frustration. One time the course got so bad  I hallucinated that the objects on my night table were being pushed towards me by an invisible hand. I can't emphasize enough how difficult, unrewarding and sacrificial this class ended up being. I always felt obligated to understand, to do better, to do extra work despite knowing that the outcome would always be bad. I stopped asking questions early on. The response to them would always be ""what don't you understand about it?"" What am I even supposed to say to that without coming off rude? What really pisses me off is that he would often tell me not to stress, not to panic, etc. Just because you tell me not to feel a certain way, does not mean I'm not going to feel it. Especially when there hasn't been an outcome that has been good.  I feel defeated before meets, before classes even before I begin working. 

Just recently today I emailed him the updated progress on my project resubmits. As expected, he didn't like it. Hence why I'm venting on Reddit. I want to stop the drinking before I get addicted. This is holiday break and I'm still slaving away for more than a C for a class that has affected my health so negatively I should really call it quits. I can't even bring these concerns up to the prof, I fear he will fail me for it. I'm even anxious to post this. I have no idea why I'm still trying so hard for a course that I'm clearly terrible at. I'll never understand animation, I'll never be good at it and I'll never meet any of the expectations set for it. And the more I work, the worse everything gets. I've stopped talking to people and find myself sitting in front of my laptop for hours. Sometimes I forget to eat and shower. I have no consistent sleep schedule, I either sleep at night or don't sleep at all. I feel so stressed out and anxious that I entertain the thought of ending things. But I know it's only temporary or at least I hope so. I'd be so furious if I ended up having to take anti depressants and attend AA meetings because of some elective. Anyways, sorry for the long vent, I just really needed to get this out. 

TL;DR Will have to seek professional help due to a college elective course I'm terrible at.",1,1,Magekk0
460,kdlmj4,2020-12-15 13:21:59,CollegeRant,Might get kicked out of college,"To summarize for the people that don’t wanna read. This is the second semester in a row where I’ve gotten below 2.0 G.P.A (unless God does something crazy to change that). If that happens you get suspended a semester.

When finding my grades/G.P.A earlier tonight it honestly broke me. I felt really good about being able to barely pass this one class that would have used this pass fail system or s/u to cover that class up. But then seeing that F on my transcript just broke me. I had the realization that if rules are rules I’m not coming back next semester. And I understand why like I’m not trying to fight it and say this isn’t fair. It’s my fault honestly. I became to comfortable during the online semester. I always due this. Never motivated to study until the last minute. Don’t utilize my school resources. Don’t get help when I need it. So I guess it’s all catching up to me. Punishment for barely getting by in college 🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️ 

Mentally/emotional it’s really getting to me. I’ve been wanting to cry about it this whole night but my body isn’t letting me lol for some reason. Just wondering how I’m gonna bring it up to family to friends about how I’m not gonna be here next semester (again there is like a tiny tiny tiny slim minuscule chance this doesn’t happen but I’m mostly sure that it will sadly). Especially family I’m just gonna feel like I’m disappointing them but honestly I always feel like that cause they praise me so much but my grades are never there. 

Honestly though. No one needs to feel bad or anything about this. I know how I got here and why. These were my mistakes and I’m being punished for them. No matter how much it hurts how much I wanna cry and how much I don’t want this to happen I have to learn and grow for it. Y’all have probably heard many stories like mine to lol. I wouldn’t know though. I literally found this Reddit and was like maybe I should write about my situation I might get some advice and I’ll probably feel better speaking about it (which it kinda is). 

I’ll miss the college experience and my friends. Cause if it does I’ll probably go back home go to a CC close to home and transfer to a Uni close to home to save more money. Or maybe I might just stay at the Uni I am at after the next semester. Who knows now. It’s in God’s hand. All I can do is hope for the best. Also for anyone wondering.

462,kdebgl,2020-12-15 04:02:14,CollegeRant,Why do I try,"All 5 of my classes were online this semester, so you know how that goes. I didn't think it would be too bad. Boy was I wrong. I took three classes for my major this semester and they just about killed me. The material itself wasn't boring, but the delivery was absolutely terrible (hour long lectures of my professors talking over a powerpoint, no lecture at all just a powerpoint with minimal information). 

Anyways in lieu of a midterm and a final my professor for my major class assigned a semester long project that consisted of three essays. Now, when I write papers, I read the rubric a million times while writing and before writing so that I don't miss anything important that could cost me my grade. When I got my grade back for the first paper, I got a 0 and the reasoning was that I ""didn't have enough information"" THE FUCK? The second essay I also got a 0 and was told to revise and resubmit. So, I resubmitted the second paper because I'm honestly just mentally drained and have no fucking clue what I even did wrong. I just got the grade back on my resubmission and to my surprise, I GOT A 0 AGAIN. My professor literally said ""I can't give you credit here."" WHAT??????

What's also pissing me off is that I read my classmate's papers (we're in groups for the project)....and they weren't that fucking great. So either everyone got a 0 or my professor just hates me. 

I wouldn't be so upset if I hadn't spent HOURS writing and rewriting and combing through the rubric. Though I'm not officially diagnosed, I'm pretty sure I have ADHD, so being able to sit down and stare at a screen for hours was already a challenge in itself. I'm currently failing the class by 5% and I'm hoping that my professor feels like not being a witch at the very end of this semester. I'm just so defeated and cannot stop crying, it feels like no matter what I do, it's not good enough.",2,1,CompleteIdeal
463,kd9akm,2020-12-14 23:23:49,CollegeRant,Professor does his job poorly = consequences for me. 2/2,"With Covid still being a thing going into Fall semester my professor changed his class from in person to slightly being online (zoom i assume) to completely online.   The assignments, project, &amp; lessons were 100% meant to be in person but the professor did almost nothing to change them. There was no lectures just notes &amp; the lesson for the class used [code.org](https://code.org) (some that i believe is 100% free). I feel that if I was given the stuff from the website &amp; that's it (for free) I would've gotten the same education as i got paying money for it. This class is required the final project was a free for all that turn into me soloing it because it was so poorly maintained. The syllabus wasn't even available for the class until LATE NOVEMBER. I was the only one that noticed that, I asked what the grading scale was and he said ""it was on the syllabus"" And when i finally looked on there... it wasn't even there. So I don't know if I can even pass the class. And when I asked him what the grading ratio was he said ""it's the standard for the school"" so I searched the Universities website from head to toe &amp; I didn't even find that. 

So I don't know my final grade, I'm did a final project that was meant for 2-5 people ON MY OWN, He's had no pity for students because of COVID and lastly, I want to compare this to the lab required by the school to take. It Has a grade ratio that I can look at, Allows me to talk to TA's for the lab  if needed, they actually RESOND to me, and they actually show a little bit of sympathy towards the students with me explaining my story of my wonderful October. Did I mention that during October I was to a point where I wanted to kill myself. Yeah, that happened. Fucking Christ, It got to a point where I went to my parents.

If my professor doesn't round up my grade, I will be getting my first ever D in all of my school years. My GPA is likely going to take a huge hit as several of my other classes are on the cusp of another letter grade, but I doubt they will round up.

This was supposed to be a finish-strong last semester of community college, yet I feel like I've done worse this semester than any year of my education. I am beyond ashamed that I let myself be so apathetic about college, especially when my mom is expecting me to excel. I know that my GPA will restart once I start university, but I feel like this will haunt me forever, more so because community college is supposed to be easier, and there's no reason why I should be getting the grades that I did.

I tried, I really did. I spent hours in front of a computer screen, cancelling plans with friends every weekend, trying my hardest. My school messed up my transcript and I was forced to take a class that I knew I couldn't handle to graduate on time, and I wish I could go back to the beginning of the semester and change all that.

My math professor hasn't posted 6 out of 8 grades we should have so far, and has not given any feedback or even indication that he's looked over any of them. We have an ""early alert"" system that went into effect in October to warn people if they were failing but with no grades, I obviously was never alerted. I'm certain I'm failing, given that I have,on many occasions, not been able to even complete all of the questions on various assignments and there's NO telling whether he knows that or not.

I've reached out through email, and he hasn't responded, he doesn't have office hours posted anywhere, the class is entirely online and most times he ends the Zoom session early or very abruptly  so there's no ""talking to him after class"". 

And now I missed the last class of the semester because I was kind of bedridden after starting a new medication with harsh side effects. He never told us that we would be doing the course evaluations on that day, even in the syllabus, and I checked to see that the window for answering the evaluation had closed. Also we had a scheduled time for our final on Thursday 12/16 but he changed it, without warning (I assume only announcing it in the class on Friday 12/11 I missed) and I only got an email about it Saturday at 5 pm that we would have the weekend to do the final, and that it's due TOMORROW at noon. The longer time to complete the test is nice but the early and extremely sudden date change is not.

If I fail, I am definitely petitioning it. I have genuinely tried this semester despite COVID, untreated ADHD, seasonal depression, being terrible at math in general, etc. etc. that I know many others also have been dealing with, and the lack of flexibility and availability of this teacher is so frustrating. I'll admit that I never went to tutoring, and that I missed some classes, but I always paid attention and took notes despite not even understanding what was being said. He never even gives us time to answer questions and just answers them himself a second later. Ughhhhh I'm working on the final right now and have no effing clue what I'm doing.

TL;DR: Math teacher has no office hours, doesn't grade or answer emails, and sprung a change in the finals schedule on us last second, so chances are I'm failing the semester without even knowing it.

I’m doing so much better this fall since I’m on track to get either A+ or A grades, and I hope to continue this trend in the winter. My only fear is that I have to take Managerial Accounting (or postpone it to Fall 2022, but I don’t want to spend my summer with this course looming in the back of my mind) in the winter, and I’m way too scared to!

I don’t ever want another C on my transcript again, but I just find accounting so incredibly difficult. I went to office hours and extra help for the beginning of Financial Accounting, but for the later chapters, I just kind of winged it which was a bad idea, yes, especially since the more difficult topics tend to be at the back of the book.

I definitely will try to take advantage of office hours and all the extra help I can get (all online) in the winter if I take it, but I’m worried that I’ll still be confused and end up with another low grade. 

I don’t plan on being an accountant in life nor do any of the future courses I will be taking require accounting classes, but these 2 are just required sadly.

470,kciai1,2020-12-13 20:40:08,CollegeRant,COVID - 19 has ruined my college career.," 

This post is a bit of a rant, and it probably doesn't extend to many other people I just wanted somewhere to express my feelings and get this all out.

Okay so to preface this I'll start by saying I'm currently going to a junior college, looking to major in applied mathematics. My classes turned to online around March of this year, and have continued to be online through this semester and will continue being online through spring of 2021.

Okay so I love math. It was always my strong suite, all the way from elementary to high school I always excelled in it. In high school I would miss math class pretty often and come just on the important days to take my tests and pass with high 80s to mid 90s in the classes. Fast forward to junior college, I was in school for about a year and a half and had no idea what I wanted to focus/major in. After some debating, I decided I wanted to pursue a career in mathematics. I wanted to do something simple, maybe just start with teaching math in high school or something.

So I began taking a decently heavy math load at my JC (nothing too intense, trig, pre cal, calc 1) and was loving it. I was doing amazing in my classes and was genuinely enjoying learning all the material.

Well once classes turned to online I just completely lost that urge to even want to learn. I began missing online lectures, I wasn't putting in the effort to take notes, I would save up homework until it was physically to much to even finish by the submit date so I'd have to rely on external resources like online calculus calculators and graphers.

I slowly felt myself slipping further behind.

I'm currently going onto a third level calculus class, and I feel like I have the knowledge of somebody who's been taking the subject for a year. I'm just BSing my tests and assignments and am lucky to get 70s on them. It just feels so demoralizing.... I was doing so good, was so excited to start my life and career.

Since all of this has occurred, I've become extremely depressed. There's family pressure on my to graduate from junior college as it's already been 3 years (would've been done after this last semester, but due to covid I'm taking less classes per semester) since I first started attending. Just knowing that I'm still at JC and I'm 2 classes behind in the subject that I want to spend my life pursuing is really making me reconsider everything. I always loved math, and never had a hard time learning it, I fall into this mental loops where I convince myself I was in over my head and should focus on something else. After this I get even more depressed thinking of all the time and effort I've spent working towards this. As it currently stands I need 2 more classes in order to get my associates, then I can transfer and actually start working on the meat of my degree. The only problem is I'm so damn behind I can't even fathom going on to taking harder level classes at a high level institution. I've bought numerous calculus books, trying to teach myself the subject, but it just feels impossible. I get agitated and frustrated when I look at these books and realize there's tens of lessons I need to learn to catch up...

Sorry to rant, but damn does this feel so unfair. I've put ample effort into my other classes, I just finished class 2 days ago and was enrolled in computer science and English. I was able to watch lectures and get stuff down, but something about math just makes it impossible for me to follow not in person.

I also had a teacher the semester before this who put in verrrrryyyy little effort, and I felt like I left the class with less knowledge than I had before it even started. If anybody read this I wanna say thank you. If anybody else is dealing with some similar situations due to covid I'd like to hear some insight and advice if you've got any.

Thanks.

I’m super disappointed in myself. This is the first time I’ve received anything less than a B in math. (I’m a freshman btw). Is getting a C bad?

I got pretty good grades on the homeworks, webassigns, quizzes but that didn’t help me on the tests.

All of my friends bearly tried and got 97s. I just let myself down again! Literally since high school I have been letting myself down at every opportunity.",3,1,Supasad77
472,kcfqyc,2020-12-13 18:29:14,CollegeRant,Hiring someone to write college papers? Think twice. [video],"Hi there!

It’s not even illegal to hire a ghostwriter for help with a college class. Wtf kind of dystopian future are we living.  I’m supposed to spread awareness about a community health issue. I chose the college paper writing industry. 

I did some “undercover” work in subreddits like r/writingservice, r/forhire, and r/onlinecollegeclass where ghostwriters advertise, “assignments, papers, discussion posts for online classes.”  

I had to record my voice and turn it into a video presentation. (only 4 minutes!). 

*\[Hiring someone to write college papers? Think twice.\](*[https://collegeessaypaperproblem.blogspot.com/](https://collegeessaypaperproblem.blogspot.com/))

It’s supposed to be a persuasive presentation for a nursing school context. (I’m pretty durable! I can handle rough criticism!) 

I placed a fake order with a company that calls itself the oldest essay/paper writing service on the Internet.

**This project is for a class about digital technology in community health.** I’ll get an “A” if some people share the video (or link to it from your blog or website). The goal is to get a lot of engagement with the video, a lot of shares, and hopefully some backlinks to improve its search visibility. 

A degree doesn’t mean anything if we live during a time in history when people can hire writers for graduate research in nursing, education, criminal justice, business, and pretty much any other discipline. Wtf kind of dystopian future are we living? 

Want to check it out and give me advice?  (I’m pretty durable! I can handle rough criticism.)

Maybe you can help me share this page on FB or link to it from your blog/site?    

It'll help me if you share a link to this presentation on your blog or website.   Message me to tell me if you do.  Link me to  it.  And thank you! ",0,1,shellyg1990
473,kce3pg,2020-12-13 17:02:03,CollegeRant,"[21, M] Currently failing every class of my Physics Major - Third Year","Hey y'all, I just joined this subreddit. I want to give some background about myself before I go on a hectic rant about my current stressful semester relapse. 

 I'm 21. I'm a physics major. Over three years into my degree. This semester's been hectic as hell because of lockdown and everything being online. I haven't studied in over 3 months, never did any assignments since I gave up on the first assignment, I stopped attending online live-classes as well as watching pre-recorded lectures since week one. I stopped seeing anyone from uni, even ghosted them online if I had to text them for help. Haven't talked to anyone my age in quite a long time. Stopped exercising/going to the gym. I even stopped handing in weekly lab reports, that I got professors checking up on me by email getting a little worked up why I haven't sent anything in.  I feel like total shit, that even though I was enthusiastic asf to work from the start of the semester, it hit me like a landslide after the first week. I started getting more anxious, lonely, pessimistic and cynical about living atm. I spent most of the weeks binging old and new shows, like 5 seasons of Lucifer, and 15 seasons of Supernatural. 

&amp;#x200B;

I even spent all of the past 3 months mostly in my bedroom pretending I'm studying to satisfy my mom coming into my room to check up on me, when really I'm just binging shows or shitposting on discord to pass the time and feel good temporarily, but deep down I feel miserable 24/7.  I announced on social media a few times on instagram, snapchat, saying that I ghosted everyone because I needed a break from this peer pressure and wanted to try focus on myself, but all I get is views but nobody who showed any sincere care. Begs the question if I even have friends at all, or if the past 3 years even summed to anything in terms of social relationships/friendships.

&amp;#x200B;

 I feel like a total flaw in my life rn. I can't even start studying today like I used to when having the drive a year back. Even seeing my counsellor every 2-3 weeks isn't enough to get me out of this rut anymore. My college website is down and I'm lost. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Also, I keep joining more servers on discord to vent or just chill, to keep distracting myself from the inevitable, but I still feel deep down guilty and miserable.  Wasting my parents' money on uni fees since I didn't do anything to study this semester, and on spotify premium..etc. is fucking me over, and given how strict asf my parents are, I know my dad will end up beating me up/kick me out of the house, like my mom kept warning me if I ever made him mad that I wasted his money. 

&amp;#x200B;

So tbh if that happens, i do feel like killing myself because I got nothing to live for anymore.  The sad thing is, I kind of like my major and have learned over the years to appreciate being in this uni, since I know I could potentially do better. 

&amp;#x200B;

I even had a way better life last year when I made a bunch of likeable friends, who now ghosted me on instagram since apparently I don't exist or am not relevant anymore, since I've stayed at home all semester due to lockdown, without much physical/social contact.  If my parents force me to drop out, and since they won't allow me to take a gap year/semester since they think I'm already too old to not graduate yet, I literally have nowhere to go atm. 

This is what happens when you have strict asian parents, and you're just a really miserable person with ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder) 24/7. I'm worried if I have to drop out or get kicked out, I will never forgive myself or learn to appreciate myself ever again, also there goes my future out of the window.

Idk if anyone will ever care reading this or even reply, since I never have luck with people responding to my vents, but it would mean a lot if y'all did, share some experiences, anything that worked or didn't work, and at least drop some advice.

Cheers. Hope y'all have a good day.",7,1,startrekzooka
474,kcddt9,2020-12-13 16:22:36,CollegeRant,I've gotten to the point where I don't care if I fail this project,"This semester has kicked my ass so hard it's a wonder I can still sit down. One class in particular has been the bane of my existence, it'd be great as an in-person one but doesn't translate well to online-only, not that my professor really gives much of a shit. I missed a couple of important assignments because of health problems that I can't make up because of her policies. I guess that's understandable and I know my grade is going to suck either way. This final project though? It's balls. 

She posted our instructions literally two days before finals week started and Jesus tapdancing Christ, this is so unnecessarily brutal. She wants a 10 page paper, a video to accompany said paper with at least 20 audio-visual elements (including background music she approves of), and then we're supposed to create a presentation to explain the paper again on Zoom this Tuesday. I've literally been a slave to this damn thing for 5 days, I had other exams 2 of those days and it was so stressful studying for those plus trying to get it done by the deadline so I don't fail. It's not going well.

Last night I was finishing the writing portion and editing the video/sourcing royalty-free audio, and suddenly I had this thought like, ""you know what, this isn't worth it. I don't care if I finish this on time or have all the requirements met, my grade is going to suck either way so what's even the point of this anymore."" I've NEVER felt this way about a class before, I'm in a national honors society/frat thing and my GPA is 3.82 because I'm such an overachiever with this stuff.

Fuck this class.",13,1,sashathebrit

476,kbk8ii,2020-12-12 06:22:53,CollegeRant,Feel like a failure. What would you do?,"Ugh, there’s so much I could say. To be brief, I’ve just had a terrible semester. Had such high hopes and started off okay, but slowly and surely it’s just snowballed out of my control and I’m depressed, anxious, and I’m danger of losing my financial aid/not graduating. 

What I’m most upset about is the missed opportunities; I like college and I love learning, but unfortunately, just wasn’t in the right space to deal with 22 credits online this semester. I didn’t have any major tragedy, just lots of bad circumstances that accumulated and wrecked my motivation and mental health. If you did well, or even okay this semester, you should be so proud. Maybe not for every class, but after 6 years of being in college, this semester overall and online-learning is SO much harder. 

Anyway, I took an elective class and really liked it. Sort of difficult (not a fluff class), but I was doing pretty well all semester. My prof seemed to really like me as I was one of the few who participated in online sessions and usually had interesting contributions, also only missed like 1.5 classes I think. Anyway, our final paper was due almost 2 weeks ago, and though I asked for a small extension, it wasn’t nearly enough time as I’d only recently started it. I’m a good writer and enjoy it, however I just couldn’t get it together. Worse was I picked a topic way too personal and triggering for me, and wanted to really make it count and write a meaningful and unique research paper, so I couldn’t just BS it. I knew my prof would appreciate my insight on the topic and that I cared enough to write a thoughtful paper on such an urgent subject. Then time passed after the deadline, and I thought there’s no way he’ll accept it; why bother. Well now I think he would’ve, but no way he will now. However he’s pretty understanding and caring which makes me feel even more guilty. I sort of want to finish it and submit it just so he knows I didn’t just not care about his class, and maybe he’ll give me a small amount of credit? Or maybe I just have to deal with my choices and do better next time. I know I should’ve reached out to him a long time ago but I was too embarrassed. 

TL;DR: I’ve, like many, had a rough semester and my mental health has plummeted. I didn’t submit a final paper for a class I really enjoyed, and it’s been almost two weeks. Should I even bother submitting anything at this point?

Anyone else ever messed up big time, though they had good intentions?

If you read this, I appreciate it. Feels good to vent, as I feel super isolated and my best friends moved away.",6,1,Prize_Dog
477,kbcsgu,2020-12-11 22:24:16,CollegeRant,Where the hell did everyone go?,"So I'm in a fairly active GroupMe for one of my online classes and most people on there usually discuss the class and encourage one another since it's been tough for everyone due to COVID. Well, after finals were done last week, the chat's been practically dead. I understand since everybody's just relieved that finals are done, but everytime I try to peep up for the sake of not losing my brains over the lack of socialization, no one reciprocates.

I've tried inviting people over for virtual hangouts with Among Us or Rocket League over the Switch, and even just asking ppl general questions like ""Did anyone get their grades yet?"" just to get some kind of conversation going. I've even gone and DM'ed some people. But again, nothing.

So like, people in colleges everywhere, incl. mine, were complaining how lOnEly and iSOlaTeD they were b'cuz of the restrictions. I get it, I'm in the same boat too, so I try to reach out time and time again (as a largely shy introvert no less!) to everyone else who I *know* feels the same, only to be met with radio silence. 

What the hell? How are you gonna complain but not do anything about it? I don't usually initiate anything IRL in the Before Times, but now *I'm* starting to be the one reaching out 'cuz of the shit we're in. If it wasn't irresponsible, I would even go out of my way to invite everyone to a bar or something and buy all of them a drink to celebrate surviving this shit semester. Is everyone just wallowing in despair and self-pity now? Where the fuck did everyone go?

478,kazptz,2020-12-11 09:36:03,CollegeRant,Just turned 28 and can’t live like this anymore..,"I left college when I was a junior (23yo) after having a terrible transfer experience and working myself into the ground to try to overcome it. Long story short, I was accepted into a brand new program and somehow fell through every single crack possible for almost my entire first semester. I still can’t talk about this without rambling on because it’s still hard for me to look back at it without getting emotional so bear with me or just skip this next part. 
I require an accommodation for extended time on tests when needed due to slow processing. I am very smart, but I take a long time to do my work and it’s always been that way. I transferred with a 3.4 gpa to study neuroscience, which was a newer program that apparently none of the staff knew anything about. I couldn’t register for classes before getting go school because the only advisor (the dept. chair), aka my assigned advisor, was on sabbatical leave that semester. I tried every department in the COLSA (sciences school within the uni) and seemed to have just called around in circles for the whole winter break, actually being told to stop calling because they couldn’t help me at one point. I just needed to know the name of my advisor so that I could get the suggested course timeline for the program I was accepted into, and so that he could more importantly tell me my registration code and date/time at which to log in and get into the courses I needed before they filled up. I ended up showing up to school unregistered and having had no one to ask about things like setting my accoms in place with DSS- all I had was my acceptance letter that said I was accepted into COLSA’s neuroscience program. 

It took me 2 weeks of walking tirelessly around a massive campus I’d never been to, being sent from one person to another, back and forth only to be told I was in the wrong place and to go see someone else, before I finally got sent to an advisor who had access to my information. She said she had never seen anything like what had happened to me and apologized profusely for the incredible amount of times I “fell through the cracks” before reaching her (each time I was sent elsewhere there would be a phone call or email saying I was on my way, so she didn’t have to take my word for what had been going on). She gave me a blank course sign-up sheet, some other papers I needed for the program, explained some basic things about the school and called over to a lady who she said would help me form a catch-up plan since I was starting off so behind. 
This was where I learned DSS is known to be backed up for Intake appts by about a month or so and that I needed this, with official results sent over electronically to each of my prof’s in order to get any of the accommodations I needed. 
I had to beg to get into chem 2, bio 2 and their labs because I was an extra body in a full course, 2 weeks behind, and with no lab partner. I didn’t catch up in those classes until the following semester and I did make-up labs for both all summer long. Those two professors were nice enough to give me some extra time on my tests but not the kind I needed, so I never did as well as I could have. The only other course I pleaded, literally, my way into I ended up with an F in because it was an elective so the prof didn’t know me from my pre-semester phone calls and efforts like the chem and bio profs did, and he thought I was trying to cheat the system from the get-go. He failed just me on my final group project and presentation just because my part of the work was always a little late getting to the group meetings. I was only ever late for those because I was at DSS waiting to cry and beg for an intake appt and they told me to “sit and wait to see if they have a second to even learn my name” which was reluctant after first telling me to go back to the website and wait my turn, every single time I showed up in tears.  

This DSS relationship carried over for 3 more semesters and they refused every time to put my accoms in place for one reason or another, one of them being that I needed an updated neuro eval and then I could reschedule the intake appt, and the final one before all 3 of them were literally fired, was that “they are in place already” despite the fact that none of my teachers could see them and their hands were tied. I didn’t get them fired, I dont think, because I never filed any kind of complaint...I was so beaten down by the time I gave up halfway through my jr year that I was incapable of getting justice for myself or telling anyone really about the experience from start to finish. I left with a 1.7 gpa, and hated myself for trying so hard to overcome my struggles and still failing. 

Here is the final point (I swear): 6 years later, I am a shell of myself still. The once confident, ambitious student who wanted to change the world of psychology one day, swearing to help those like me growing up who might not understand their panic attacks, anxiety, etc. when they are young students, and to educate their teachers about dealing with those students properly, not forcing participation in class or further embarrassing the student by trying to see what’s wrong. I had such passion for this kind of stuff, driven by my own experiences, and I couldn’t wait to become the adult I was going to become one day. I used to write a lot better as well; to be honest i have avoided the entire “writing” and education thing for 6 years now. 

I want to stop being like this, and I want to finally finish what I started. I want my brain to get back to the level of functioning it used to and I grow more anxious, depressed, and further ashamed every year that goes by and I am still a victim and a failure. But I have no idea where to start. Neuroscience is not an option because I have to finish online, and the BS psychology programs I have found won’t utilize any of my science classes, labs or psy bio work. 

Can anyone possibly help me find some kind of starting point to getting back on track? I have to accept my 1.7 gpa despite the extensive appeals I wrote and never sent in to the school that most likely would have expunged an F or 3, at least...but nowhere will accept that low of a gpa. 
I also have so much student debt from my 3 years already, that I cannot afford to go the easy route and start over, doing business or something, on a clean slate and lose more than I absolutely have to credits-wise. I really want this, and this is so overwhelming trying to choose an online school/program that I’m worried I am going to shut down again. I don’t want to wake up in another 3 years knowing that I am that much older, and that much further from regaining my sense of self ever again.. 

Thanks guys if anyone actually made it to the bottom of this post, and again I am so sorry but I am literally incapable of creating a short version.",1,1,PositiveDragonfly1
479,kaul7a,2020-12-11 03:20:28,CollegeRant,"Come cry with me. Also, cut yourself some slack. We're in a pandemic.","I'm a junior psych major and this semester of online class has literally been hell on earth for me, as i'm sure it has been for a lot of other students. At this point i'm convinced i'm simply not made for online learning, which is a scary realization considering I don't know when i'm going to be back on campus again. My grades have suffered tremendously. I made a 3.6 last semester now i'll be lucky if I get a 2.5 this time around. I know it could be worse, but it's hard to see it that way when i've set such a rigid standard for myself for so long.

I keep trying to reassure myself that things were simply out of my control, and there is really nothing much I could have done about it. But even though I understand that, I can't help but feel so defeated.

I know there are students out there who had the same challenge with online classes as I did, but being surrounded by friends who are making the same grades they've always made or straight up thriving with the online semester makes me feel even worse. And even the ones that were struggling somehow pulled through and it seems like i'm the only one who's come out with shitty grades. I know everyone's experience is going to be unique and I shouldn't compare myself to anyone else but I keep wondering if maybe I could have done more, studied harder or stayed up later. 

Honestly, I know deep down I should really just cut myself some slack. Sometimes I think as college students we have tendency to be too hard on ourselves. We set these rigid standard and beat ourselves up when we fail even when it's obvious the odds were stacked against us. I'm sure we can all agree this year was awful, this entire semester has been so unprecedented, I mean we're literally living through a pandemic. If there's any year we should be able to give ourselves a break it's 2020. It's gonna take me a while to fully accept this, and I go back and forth between acceptance and feeling like a loser about 50 times a day but if anyone else is going through this same thing, **this semester doesn't define who you are as a student.** You're still doing amazing sweetie. 

Anyway, like I said, i'm still struggling to practice what I preach and you know what they say, misery loves company. Is anyone else struggling with a huge drop in their grades? Come cry with me and complain about this dumpster fire of a semester.",7,1,cherriblossom_
480,kasgo0,2020-12-11 01:20:12,CollegeRant,didn't hand anything in for 3 months- help,"So I'm a freshmen in college and I had to start my classes online because of COVID. I'm pretty sure I have undiagnosed ADHD, but regardless, I experience severe executive dysfunction when it comes to school. I handed in assignments for my classes for the first 2 weeks of school, but after that, I completely stopped. Literally.

It all started when I just missed a couple assignments- flash forward to November and I haven't handed ANYTHING in since September (I only did work for my acting class). I dropped 2 classes (spanish and science) and figured that I would just be part time for the rest of the semester. I would just focus on Intro to psychology and acting.

Now it's December and the semester ends next week- the only homework I've done was in the beginning of September. I did a couple tests though, but its obvious I cheated since I didn't hand in the textbook assignments. I don't know what to do.... I pretty much will have a 0.02 grade or something for that class which will crush my GPA. My acting is only a 70% at the moment. There is a thing called ""resolution for incomplete grades"" but why would the professor bother helping me if its obvious I didn't try at all since September? the worst part... psychology was what I was thinking about majoring in. I would want to retake the class again because I actually want to learn the material. But either way I have the horrible situation I got myself in with my grades that could ruin my financial aid.

I don't know what to do.... I'm just so screwed and hope they don't kick me out of college.",7,1,coopersushi
481,kaob61,2020-12-10 21:10:31,CollegeRant,"Professor doesn't respond to emails, and posts EVERYONES grade online publically for everyone to see.","So I've been having this problem with a professor. First off, he doesn't respond to emails. I mean at all.  He has only given us... 4 assignments, a midterm and an essay throughout this semester, which is great. But its confusing where to upload the assignments. So some students email them to him, only thing is he doesn't check his emails so he doesn't give me the grade I should have for it. His response is ""I don't always check emails, you have to tell me to check."" while in class. Isn't it his job to check his emails everyday for important information though? As a student I've been taught to constantly check your emails to not miss out on anything. So I try to send him emails to ask about my current grade as well (I want to make sure I'm being graded as well as doing well in his class) and of course I get no response. Other students don't get responses from him ether. Yes I know he has a life, but he's not doing his part in what is a very complicated hard time for the both of us adapting to online class.

So the other big thing is people are wondering where's the grade from the essay we've done over two months ago is. Someone brings it up during online class and he goes ""its on blackboard if u press this and that"" and its all online. Everyone's grade is there to look at. For every assignment, as well as attendance and if a student isn't making an effort. So everyone gets put on blast. A few students called him out for it and his response was ""its online class, you don't know each other anyways"" but honestly its the principle.",4,1,corndogs1001

The professor was a really cool guy, around 72. We would normally talk about how to write stories, what was going on in the world, and life lessons. It was easily my favorite class, and I picked up writing stories quite fast; he told me I was doing leagues better than some people. Once spring break hit, my midterm grade was an A.
Then corona hit and classes became online. That transition was...rough to say the least. Even though I lived at home, I did a majority of my work on campus because working from home is difficult because I get distracted easily at home. 
All of my professors communicated and gave assignments through D2L, except my journalism professor, who talked exclusively through outlook/student email. As for someone who rarely checks his email, this sucked. I missed some assignments and even turned my final in late, resulting in the D. He emailed me after grading it and saying that he understood, and teaching online was awful for him. What’s worse is that I was focused on making sure my other grades didn’t fall, so I ended up with 2 As, 2 Bs and a glaring D. Now my parents want to see my grades because they are helping me pay for college, and I have to explain al this to them (even though I know they won’t understand).

It's beyond me that college students haven't gone up and rallied against how fucking abhorrent of a job administrators have done in creating pandemic university. But that's not my point. My point is how fucking frustrating it is having no motivation all semester to lift a finger for assignments. I barely did daily readings while working in the day and then falling asleep after cause of my insomnia from not having a usual routine. Online classes just didn't give me the high interest I would typically feel from an actual lecture class. One class was where the the professor had us do twice weekly work that mimicked being in a 75 minute physical class, but online. You can guess how well that went. 

It hurt the most that my creative nonfiction writing class was hit when I would usually be really passionate about creative writing as an English major. I didn't have the drive to put my all into my final writings until about a week and a half ago. I got the chance to write about a topic that really grabbed me. Only I've been having such a hard time with concentration that I took a long time to put full effort.

487,k9nag8,2020-12-09 07:13:17,CollegeRant,Punishing Students for Not Attending Lectures is so stupid,"Many of the classes post the lectures online but certain a-hole professors literally punish people for not showing up to lectures. Sometimes people have things going on and can’t make it. It literally infuriates me how professors baby sit adults for not coming to lectures.

We are all adults especially as seniors in a 400 lvl class they shouldn’t do that, as whether we show up or not is our decision as i’m paying for that class. If i decide not to show up to lectures and bomb the midterm that is my prerogative.  I should’ve showed up to lecture then 🤷🏾‍♂️. Especially with such an unprecedented time being stuck inside and sitting there on your laptop listening to someone talk especially when it’s super early in the morning is not the mood.

Professors literally have attendance as 10% of your grade so stupid. I’ve been sitting stuck inside since early march on quarantine and nothing really seems to matter anymore as everything is just screwed up. We have a president more worried about pushing his conspiracy theories then stopping his country from getting burned to the ground because of the pandemic. 

With all this going on professors are worried about people showing up to lectures. You get paid all the same don’t you? If i had somehow caught the coronavirus and was sick asf and missed two weeks of class you’re going to punish me for that? Whats the point of posting your lectures then if you punish us for not showing up. You know what a good incentive would be? Not posting lectures to force attendance",6,1,jklifexxx

my professor put 4 marks on each question and 4 of those questions were multiple choice. one question wasnt and i thought we could put letters; turns out, we can’t. so i lost 4 fucking marks because i put a letter when i didn’t even know. 

it happened to other students too. i sent her emails but she doesn’t reply. we talked to her in class, but she’s not gonna help us. what would she lose if she helps us? she said so herself; online school is hard and all of us are struggling with it, so why not have some mercy on us and help? i’m a freshman in engineering. i wanted to get a high gpa for my cumulative gpa to be high from the beginning of my university career, but now if i get a 70 in calculus and physics, i’ll be grateful.

Ever since the pandemic started and transitioned into online it has been challenging in some way or another. And also aware some people have had more challenges than others. But by all means it does not mean just because you have a friend doing well and keeping up with the class doesn’t mean they’re obligated to help you and let you copy their answers because you’re struggling. You are an adult, chose to be in college, it is YOUR responsibility to get your work done and no one else’s.  I know this is not always cut and dry but I’m speaking for the majority. It is not fair to the students who actually take notes in during lecture, study for hours and turns their work on time for their friend to ask them to copy. I don’t mind helping my friends if they don’t understand a concept or the prompt to an assignment but their meaning of “help” is wanting the answers and that’s where I put my foot down.

Freshman years have always been hard for me because of transition into a new environment, but online college is making it 300 times worse. 

Finals are coming up and aside from the usual stress of wanting to pass my class, I’ve just realized that I’m late to start looking at my spring classes. This wouldn’t be as stressful if the common core class I HAVE to take to move onto any other math/science course was literally full and closed. 

I know this is partly my fault but everything is so overwhelming and confusing. Everything feels like it’s falling apart, it’s like I’m constantly messing up and I’m never sure if the courses I’m taking are the courses I need. What am I doing in college? Am I just wasting money?

493,k6nybk,2020-12-04 16:19:21,CollegeRant,Professor Accused Me of Cheating,"Due to COVID all of my classes are online. In one course, my professor assigns homework assignments with unlimited attempts.

Long story short, my professor saw that I attempted a multiple choice homework over 70 times and assumed I was guessing answers until I got it right without any studying. The homework is set up in a quiz format on Canvas which I believe is to combat cheating. Therefore, there's not a way to see what you exactly did wrong. Also, there were about 70 questions on the quiz, so to guess through all of them would take WAY over 70 attempts.

I studied my resources, attempted the homework, and if I saw I got a bad score, I attempted it again until I got a perfect score.

I was also using the homework as a study tool. I thought the purpose of him allowing us to have unlimited attempts WAS to use the homework as a study tool to ""quiz yourself"". In another course, the professor actually encouraged us to take advantage of the unlimited attempts on homework as a way to study.

Why even have an assignment with unlimited attempts if you believe if someone attempts it a high amount of times they are cheating? 

While he didn't state anything about taking any huge action, mainly because he assumed, he announced to the class that he cut the number of attempts.

Also, another thing that bothers me is that he didn't bother to talk about the situation with me. He just saw the many attempts, assumed I cheated, and got hot headed and reacted by limiting the attempts and sending out a passive aggressive message to the class.

I am a bit worried that this may get escalated and I'll have to fight through some BS and people trying to not hear me out in my favor. I did send him a message explaining my intentions as well as a little about me. In conclusion, this is a reason I dislike online learning.

I go to a really small college located in a desolate rural community and lemme tell you something The teachers in this fucking place were already sketchy to begin with now that we’re doing classes online these motherfuckers don’t do a goddamn motherfucking thing. My tuition is $20,000 a fucking year for what for my teacher to sit in their house with no pants on and not even fucking record a goddamn fucking lecture for me all my teachers have submitted their work on to an online platform that connects students and teachers and allows them to collaborate on work and see grades in post comments to one another etc. all my teachers this semester with the exception of my American sign language teacher have literally done the absolute bare minimum fucking possible from either not doing lectures or not posting A time constraint or dates for things that are due in the syllabus like shit just doesn’t make any fucking sense there isn’t rubrics there isn’t any structure like it’s just you doing work that they put online and then getting a shitty fucking grade because you really don’t know how to do it and then never talking about it correcting it going over it I have literally learned so little this semester and I’m fucking pissed about it. Not to mention half my teachers take over a day to fucking answer an email and usually when I email them I need an answered within that day. Some thing else that really gets me motherfucking mad is the fact that my school is like very hands-on very in person very small classes like we do really crazy shit and fun shit and we didn’t really get to do anything this semester and like I was kind of like expecting like videos or like I don’t know shit that was like interesting for us to do or like to make learning fun like it’s really not that fucking hard to send us a fucking YouTube link or some bullshit like I don’t even know but all I know is that for as much as I’m paying I really am not getting jack shit out of it I had to take a statistics class online and I would spend six hours a day teaching myself statistics because my teacher would only send me 30 pages of notes via email no lecture no response back never answered her phone or her email and it was the worst fucking experience of my life I somehow managed to get a C+ in the class but still like come on if I’m expected to put the work in because I’m paying for college that I’m expecting my teachers to put the work in because they’re getting paid .

496,k4ucdd,2020-12-01 21:17:25,CollegeRant,The Last Straw,"Yesterday, I broke down in tears because of the overwhelming stress and burnout. It was too much for me to handle.

Last night, I was in a study group call before I dmed my best friend (who was in the call as well). I was asking how she was doing, and after I unpackaged what I was going through the couple of weeks, I felt like I was at the edge of a cliff, pushed to my limit. I was muted in the group call and quietly sobbing so my siblings next door couldn't hear. I just wanted to be sad for 3 minutes, and let it all out. 

I was ranting to my friend about exams were whipping my butt and how my trash group project members weren't contributing and I was basically carrying 2 useless people on my shoulders with one of the members dropping the class. Today, another person dropped the class, so now it's just me and the other dog trash member who ignores my texts and emails. 

With water rushing to my eyes, I told her I was so tired and so overwhelmed that I was numb. My mental state was in survival mode for 5 weeks straight and I was afraid I couldn't make it to finals which are in about 2 weeks. But out of all of the people I trusted, my best friend brushed me off by saying, ""Do you best.""

I left the call and slept the rest of the night.

I only need 2 more quarters until I graduate, but I'm so messed up this quarter, I don't know if I have the strength to get to the finish line. I'm trying though. I've been trying ever since we had online classes. I'm broken, exhausted, but I'm breathing. Sometimes I don't even know if I know how to breathe. Today is another day, but my sadness and stress continues to follow me. I'm doing better today than yesterday...I hope that is enough to keep me from reaching the finish line of this horrible, horrible year.

The problem is, I live with my parents and things have been rough between them lately, so they argue more than before. They don't seem to care whether I'm attending my classes or doing my homework, they'll scream at each other anyway. I tried telling them so many times to just ignore and stay away from each other, but they never listen and instead tell me to go back studying as if I'm a machine that can just mute everything around them.

The pandemic has already taken a toll on my mental health and their goddamn arguments are just making things worse. With finals coming up soon and a class I'm currently failing and want to catch up in, I'm worried I'll screw big time towards the end of this semester even though I had really high hopes at the beginning.

498,k4ggnu,2020-12-01 07:45:16,CollegeRant,I've managed to keep my head high for the last 3.5 years but today I have been broken,"It wasn't even terrible news. I got a 10.5/15 on a paper. But it's everything around it that really just tipped the scale.

My school, like many, went online during spring break. We said goodbye to our friends, said we'd see them soon, and we haven't seen each other since. It's been all Zoom and quarantine since then. I'm starting to miss people and since I'm a senior and my University is guaranteed online next semester, I'm never going to see some of them again.

Speaking of people I'll never see again, my estranged uncle died mid semester and the family was a mess over it, so that was cool. He died on the other side of the country and all we got back was his cellphone. And since I'm a digital forensics minor, my family kept insisting that I ""hack into"" his phone to see what he's been up to. I tried telling them it wasn't that simple and there was no way I had time to do it with school but they insisted. So eventually I ended up pawning the job to my professor who was nice enough to just dump all the info we needed into a thumb drive for us.

Like many college kids, I have a job. I work in a grocery store. This whole year has been a shit show for us. People hoarding goods, employees getting quarantined, rule changes every week, etc. Constant stress. No reward whatsoever.

And the school work. Fuck the school work. Professors don't even teach anymore. They start zoom calls, brief us for assignments, then shit on the assignments when we turn them in. Absolutely no compassion on their end. They'll take forever to grade papers because ""this semester has been so hectic"" but they won't make things any easier for us.

My University decided for some reason that instead of making the semester 16 weeks like every other, we could get by with 12 and a half including finals. We not only had to relearn how to take in information, we had to do it under a serious time crunch. Every single class, even the 400 level classes with labs, had to be crammed into the 12 weeks. And some classes were worse. They were only given 6 weeks to cram in the entire class. For some reason, my school insisted on finishing before Thanksgiving. Not sure why, it's not like the internet was gonna disappear in December.

And let me cram in one more thing: I heard multiple times from professors ""I know the class average was a 60 but I had 3 hundreds so clearly it wasn't a problem with the lectures."" Lemme stop you right there- those people cheated. They took advantage of you. You were nice enough to not make us use a lockdown browser, and they decided to Google answers. And don't get me wrong, the rest of us could have googled answers so maybe it's a case of ""the nice guy finishes last"", but don't act naive.

That all leads us to today's problem. I've taken finals and turned in every assignment. But I'm still getting grades from assignments I turned in a month ago because the professors haven't had time to grade them. This literally feels like I'm in an abusive relationship with my notifications. I look at them hoping for something good and I just keep regretting it. I finally felt like I could relax after finals, but I keep getting grades and feedback on assignments. And these aren't negligible assignments either, these are like 20% of my overall grade a piece. These are assignment that the feedback on would have been appreciated a month ago when I could've done anything about it. Now if I fucked up, it's too late and I just have to deal with it. The hard work and studying I did for finals was worthless because apparently I started fucking up weeks ago and didn't even know it.

I'm fucking struggling. Next semester is my last and I need to get into grad school. This doesn't even feel fair, I tried so fucking hard to raise my GPA for the past 2 years and now my GPA is gonna tank again because I had to go through a semester where actually teaching material wasn't even a top priority for half the professors.

500,k367a0,2020-11-29 08:48:35,CollegeRant,covid made me regret my choice of college,"like any 18 year old with an only half formed brain I used my feelings to pick my college instead of considering the financial costs. however, after freshman and fall of sophomore year I had been starting to feel like it was finally worth it. in high school I was so horrible at any sort of socializing or acting like a normal human being, so starting out at a 4 year instead of community college helped me feel like I had a new start and it wasn't just going to be high school 2 electric boogaloo. i finally felt normal for a bit (my family is not so great at communicating so that may be part of it) and had my own group of friends i was getting close with on campus. also, along with the facilities, I made sure to take advantage of the events and employer talks that were constantly happening. I also really valued my independence, did shit like buy my own groceries, and walk everywhere with friends or by myself and was even looking into renting an apartment.

now I'm in my junior year, which i had been hyping myself up to as being even better than sophomore year (which fuck me for being optimistic I guess) and have none of that, but I'm still saddling myself with the same amount of stupidly high debt and made the decision to overload myself with courses to make up for it. despite being someone who grew up with the internet, I could never make online friends because everything about interactions online has always had a sense of detachment to me which translates even to people I know irl, and i feel our conversations online never have the same spark they do when were in person.

I had picked my non stem major because i not only enjoyed it, but because I was confident in my skills regarding it, but not being able to suck it up and work through online classes makes me doubt myself. I literally hate all of the work I've been doing this year.

Another thing that sucks about all this happening junior year is that this and next year were supposed to be when you do internships but now all of that is either nonexistent or online, and it would be worthless for me to do it online, because i already am failing at the online format for school so I'd probably be a really sucky online intern. 

Also, our school is going online next semester too. I was going to take a semester off, but that would mean losing my two student jobs, and apparently my major has certain class requirements that only happen in the spring semester that I have to take before other classes, so because I'm a junior I have to take them next semster, or I'll delay my schedule by who the fuck knows how long. I'm going to take those two requirements as a part time student next semster, but everything is still going to suck.

I want to be productive, like all those people who are exercising and ""bettering their life,"" and all that shit during quarantine but I guess I rolled the dice for shit brain in life, and it still feels like my fault that I haven't fixed it. 


tl;dr I'm sick of online classes, and now literally all I see at the end of the road now is graduating with no experience gained, a shit ton of debt, and no job opportunities. If I had picked my other choice of college at least I'd only have 2 out of the 3.",2,1,rantyeetaway
501,k2yeqi,2020-11-28 23:42:11,CollegeRant,COVID Rant,"So I have a bit of dilema going on right now. My school sent a mass email saying while they understand COVID is going up, we’re still going to be in person for the remainder of the semester. We’ve been in person for the entire semester so this isn’t surprising, BUT they’re going to leave it up to the students if they want to return after thanksgiving break, all we have to do is email our professor and we can go online. 

The problem is, after thanksgiving break, we only have two weeks left....one regular week and then we have to be back on campus for finals week. So essentially, they waited till the final week of class to say “well, if you really don’t feel safe on campus, stay online for a week longer I guess” and that really annoys me. I’m not sure if I’m overreacting but it really pisses me off that they forced us to be in person for the entire semester, even with high Covid cases in our area, and they waited till literally the last week of class to give us the option to go online....I’ve had countless kids in my classes catch COVID and I’m just really annoyed right now. I’m an architecture major so I basically live in our studio classroom with a bunch of other students.

507,jzv054,2020-11-24 01:11:15,CollegeRant,Online College and it’s major flaws,"Hello fellow College students. I am a first year student attending University for the first time (online), and I just wanted to point out a couple of gripes I have with it. I know it’s unproductive to complain since there’s not much we can do about it due to covid. But regardless, I don’t think institutions are doing much at all to address the issues and create better solutions for students who are struggling. Here are some of my biggest issues as a student who prefers in-human support learning:

1: Classes are boring-  The coursework for my major consists of a lot of hands on stuff (interviewing, photography, writing,etc.), and with online lectures and reading posted notes to educate myself, it feels like I am not getting much value from it. Even if I was doing extremely well, I feel as though I would not be learning much real world skill in my medium. I wish I was doing that well though, because honestly the format is so boring to me that I can barely keep up with the zoom lectures, let alone the mind numbing assignments. Even hopped up on adderall I still feel bored, which is saying something. But most teachers have not much sympathy for students who simply don’t find any interest in their class. I blame the online format though not the profs.

2: No physical assignments-   I guess you could say I’m a bit old fashioned, but I really miss being able to hand in physical copies of my work. The concept of doing all assignments on a screen just kills my engagement. I took a degree that involves a lot of writing, but the joy I get from physically writing notes down is basically nonexistent in the work assigned. Even the idea of having to go type out an assignment in a distinct format with no creative freedom kills my motivation a little bit more and makes me feel like I’m just feeding my work to a grading machine.

3: The course website is way over-complicated &amp; unclear-     My school uses blackboard which seems to be a fine service for delivering educational content. The problem for me is just the overwhelming amount of weekly posts being uploaded by every single professor. It feels like a lot to keep track of &amp; makes it very difficult to manage assignment priorities. If I were to miss a couple days of reading the uploads (which I have), I feel completely lost in what’s going on once I check again. Also the amount of content posted is purely overwhelming.

4: It feels completely undisciplined-   Simply put, it feels like there is no guidelines or any metric of strictness to help keep me in line. I have always able to flourish in strict learning environments with teachers who know how to get the most out of students. But online feels like there is no discipline whatsoever, and I have a hard time disciplining myself (obviously this is my fault). It feels like there is not much in place to support others like me who benefit from stricter guidelines and clear objectives. Online feels like getting a zero doesn’t even matter and it could not bother me any less. I need structured learning.

5: The Assignments feel sloppy and unproductive-    This one all depends on the professor to be fair. But what I’ve found so far with most my class assignments is that most assignments are just tweaked slightly from the in class version in order to ‘suit online learning’. This sucks tbh, because they aren’t even adapting their content to fit the new learning format. Most assignments feel so disengaging that it’s hard to put my authentic self into them and produce my best work. Also the fact that I have to teach myself how to do most of them feels like I am not being taught, but rather reaching myself, which I could do 100x better without any format and just simple internet access.

*Sidenote: I know this sounds whiney and is basically just a bunch of excuses. But it’s the excuses that would not exist had I been able to learn in class. I know it’s nobody’s fault, just expressing my thoughts on why online sucks so bad for a student like me. Especially as a first year coming in brand new to College, it has been rough.


TL;dr- I’m complaining about reasons online school sucks for me and basically using excuses to vent my frustrations with Online College. No blame towards the professors, Ik it sucks for everyone. 


If you bothered to read any of this lmk what u think. Please don’t come at me for making excuses I’m fully aware that I am doing it. Just wanted to give my take on it.",5,1,weeb_d3stroyer

I'm a senior in this hell trying to sign up for classes and of course for the past few weeks all my required courses are ""full"". Funny how for freshman classes like English Comp they have endless openings but as you progress they have less and less classes, usually with some moron professor with a 1.5 rating on Rate My Professor.

Please explain how a fully online course can have a 50 person limit? It's not like the professor does anything anyways. 95% of the time they just copy and paste their assignments and quizzes from the internet, they never respond to emails, and the assignments grade automatically. Guess it would be too much to ask them to do their job. 

And so once again I'm left in a situation where I'm failing a class and I have one class that I was able to sign up for next semester. Maybe by 2035 I'll be able to graduate. Fuck school!",4,1,tropicalYJ
509,jzgu2v,2020-11-23 12:37:39,CollegeRant,My grades feel like they're slipping out of my own control.,"I'm a senior economics student and I see the light of freedom but this quarter is really taking it's toll on me physically and mentally. For my senior econometrics class the chair of our program is my professor, I heard generally good things about her and decided to take her class. There was one glaring flaw early on however, we have 2 research projects and they require coding in R. That's fine, learning a new coding language can be really useful, the only problem is she never taught it once. We are only given files with sample code and she asks that we code entire models based solely on that. They don't even include everything she is asking in the project and there are steps missing, meaning you can't get the models to work unless you knew the language already. Not one lecture does she do actual instruction on it, instead she cops out and puts us into breakout rooms in Zoom in the hopes we teach one another an entirely new coding language. Only the data analytics people know what's going on for our projects and we only could pray to god you had one in your group, I had no idea what I was doing in R for my first project and couldn't teach myself it in time, I felt so bad for my groupmate. After the midterm it just went all downhill. We get assigned new groups and I get a friend of mine and 2 other international students. Those 2 could barely speak english and never attended class, they were lost and basically useless. I knew Vietnamese and could communicate with one of them but honestly she was just an airhead rich girl. They did nothing, they broke the english of the paper, they couldn't do anything and didn't understand anything going on. Basically leaving me and my friend to do the project, by this point I finally understood R but not enough to fully do the project, by dumb luck my friend was data analytics and worked me through the rest. We barely finish on time and it was rushed like crazy and stressful as hell watching 2 idiots undo all your work. Now comes finals... I might actually fail. I'm trying so hard but I might actually fail. She hasn't done a proper lecture in nearly a month October 27th was the last released lecture recording. Class for the last month has been a 15 minute announcement and agenda debriefing and then straight to the goddamn breakout rooms until the end of class. She did a complete 180 and stopped lecturing, now we have an hour breakout room to do a problem set then we leave, the problem is no one has any idea how to do the problem sets because we only have text modules to teach us. She enters the rooms to check on us and gets angry when people don't know what to do. Finals are coming today and I just am so lost, I have been trying to teach myself all quarter but it's just too much to do with no resources provided by her. I used to thrive in lecture, that's how I learned and I can even learn in online lecture but she has completely stopped trying. My grades feel like they're out of my control and it's been stressing me out to the point where I'm getting ill. I need to just pass this class to get CR but im scared that I might not even make it.",0,1,AVerySkilledAsian
510,jzenyf,2020-11-23 09:36:18,CollegeRant,Feeling trapped in school,"I’m 24. If I take 48 credits between now and May I can graduate (quarter system). That would look like 2 classes over winter break, five in winter quarter and five in the spring...assuming I pass every class this quarter.

A little backstory —

I was a pretty good student in high school - not a genius but pretty sharp. Never failed classes but didn’t necessarily get straight A’s, you know the type.

I started  college fresh out of HS. After pursuing a degree in music for 3 semesters (1/10 would not recommend) I decided to drop out and work full-time.

I took six courses over the span of about 18 months and decided to transfer back to a university in early 2019. 

However, I didn’t consult with a counselor before transferring my credits...

52 of my music credits were placed into “Open Electives” that have no impact towards graduation. That’s a full year of school wasted.

My counselor won’t budge on ANY of those credits. Not one. They’re useless.

I’ve split the cost of my education 50-50 with my parents up until this past quarter (Autumn). My family is paying for my education completely now and I’m starting to feel like a total financial burden. My income is the lowest it’s been in years and I’m living with my mom  for free.

If I drop out I’m basically sending a huge middle finger to my mom. She’s recently divorced and not where she used to be financially, yet she’s spending thousands of dollars for me to get my diploma.

But I honestly don’t know if I can do it. I tried taking five classes this past quarter and had to withdraw from one because I couldn’t keep up with the new online classroom. 

The quarter just wrapped up and I’m worried I might have failed one of my other four.

I just don’t know how long I can keep chasing the carrot of graduation that’s being dangled in front of my face like I’m a horse.",1,1,hummusbro

512,jz2z66,2020-11-22 20:36:05,CollegeRant,Grade dropped exponentially because of online classes,"I had journalism as a Gen-Ed this semester. The professor was a really cool guy, around 72. We would normally talk about how to write stories, what was going on in the world, and life lessons. It was easily my favorite class, and I picked up writing stories quite fast; he told me I was doing leagues better than some people. Once spring break hit, my midterm grade was an A.
Then corona hit and classes became online. That transition was...rough to say the least. Even though I lived at home, I did a majority of my work on campus because working from home is difficult because I get distracted easily at home. 
All of my professors communicated and gave assignments through D2L, except my journalism professor, who talked exclusively through outlook/student email. As for someone who rarely checks his email, this sucked. I missed some assignments and even turned my final in late, resulting in the D. He emailed me after grading it and saying that he understood, and teaching online was awful for him. What’s worse is that I was focused on making sure my other grades didn’t fall, so I ended up with 2 As, 2 Bs and a glaring D. Now my parents want to see my grades because they are helping me pay for college, and I have to explain al this to them (even though I know they won’t understand).

I’m in my seventh week of university and midterms are approaching. I have been rethinking my decision ever since I started university. As a requirement, my university requires us to learn german along with the other courses, no matter what the major is. 

The classes I’m taking are Chemistry, Physics, Calculus, German, English, and Chemistry lab. The only classes i’m truly enjoying are german and english. my grades in chemistry and lab are good only because I have taken the material before. Calc and Physics are a different story. 

When I was still deciding what I wanted to major in, my mom told me if I wanted to major in English or languages, she would support it and I remember being the happiest person ever. I didn’t choose that because there are no jobs whatsoever, but my university has a major where they combine business, communications, and languages; that way students get exposure to all three sides. I think that’s a great major and would allow me to have a variety of job opportunities, however I’m not sure if it’s the right decision. 

A part of me thinks that I’m only feeling this way because it’s online and I haven’t experienced actual university, but another part of me thinks that this isn’t actually for me. I’m lost.

514,jy3sp2,2020-11-21 03:31:07,CollegeRant,Online college is hell for extroverts: A rant.,"I am an extreme extrovert and *was* a 3.9 GPA college computer science student. When covid hit all my 14 on-campus credits went online before the semester started. I was studying from home.  

First week of fall classes I setup my desk all pretty, got an aesthetic planner with cute stationery and sat my PC from 9am-5pm on zoom or listening to lectures. No human contact save for the awkward classmates over zoom. This routine only lasted 1 week before I became burnt out and flat out stopped studying. 

But I still didnt drop after 1 week. I told myself I needed to adapt. I thought ""W*hat if college remains online in the future. Get used to studying online because the pandemic has made work-from-home the norm and you need to adapt.""* 

But I did anything but study.

I just cheated using online calculus calculators and test banks on quizlet. I wrote 400 word technical writing drafts at 11:45pm sunday night after sunday night, always 15 minutes before the deadline. To cope with the lack of socialization I spent all day on discord talking to people across the globe and making art instead of studying. I socialized all night and slept all day, never joining another zoom session or tutor video. To anyone who asked what I did all day and night in my room  I said ""studying online"" but I knew I was lying through my teeth. I so desperately wanted to be in school, to learn, to get closer to my goals, to be around my peers, but not like this. 

School to me was greeting my professor as I took a seat at the front of the class. School to me was sharing with my classmates what answers we wrote on the 3rd question of the exam after it was done and explaining our thought process. School to me was sneaking into random student events in the study hall happening between the off hours between classes for free food and a lecture on some cool student-run project. And as a commuter student, school to me was reciting my notes to myself as I drove to class after work, dressed my best and excited to perform what I learned. 

When the Fall midterm hit in October I had a mental breakdown in my room at 8pm and missed them because I wasnt prepared. Over the next few days I had to drop 3 classes because my grades would inevitably plummet. I dropped the 4th class 1 week ago. Then I withdrew from the semester.

 I dont want to look at what will happen to my financial aid yet.

I know. I did so many things wrong. And of course, thousands of dollars of credits down the drain, paid for myself. Graduation date pushed forward inevitably. I'm not even sure I'm suited to be in my college major anymore. I'm not sure im suited to even be in college anymore.

516,jxhmu8,2020-11-20 03:27:08,CollegeRant,I really regret picking philosophy as my program (Senior Year),"I seriously goofed picking philosophy as a major. I wanted to be a lawyer originally, but then I realized I only aspired to that because of my demanding parents that don't understand me and just coerced me into doing it. 

I'm happy the program made me a better person, both my parents are sexist, racist, and otherwise just very conservative in the bad ways. A lot of that misunderstanding rubbed off on me, but after reading all these texts, it really changed me.

That being said, I can't help but feel so hateful towards this program. I haven't felt like I've gained any useable skills. They say you'll gain critical thinking skills with philosophy, but honestly that's not really true and wasn't worth the $40,000. All this writing about the same stuff has ruined my curiosity because I associate reading with being judged and marked. I hate that some of these philosophers write so cryptically (except Hegel, Hegel is lit), but we are forced to write as clearly as possible. It just seems contradictory. If they can write so obscurely and be celebrated why can't we be a bit more creative?

My grades are fine, but I just drudge through the course material and this online class nonsense doesn't help. I have no more connection to philosophy done in this way anymore, I just want to watch philosophy youtube instead and let myself not think. I have no idea what kind of jobs I'll even be able to get as a philosophy major (technically bioethics). I wish I picked anything else at this point, but it's too late because I'm in my senior year.

It took me four years to realize I can't stop disliking what I don't enjoy doing. I'm just stuck in this spot for another 6 months and I really hate it. I feel like I'm going to explode if I have to read another paper on the Ancient Greeks and how great their thinking was or attend another classs where some snooty teen tries to flex his brain juices to bolster their ego.",6,1,NotAddicted2Reddit

I know a big part of college is building a community of people of similar interests. I’m deeply sympathetic to all the freshmen who have had that opportunity stripped away because of the virus. However I will say hybrid learning has its perks. My university has it set up so that for senior year, you only have to do you lab and design classes in person. Everything else is typically online and I love it. 

I love setting my own schedule for class and meeting up with friends to work through course content. I like the loose structure of exams and that I am able to take my time and get the work done right, I love the fact that I don’t have to go all the way on campus for non-essential meetings and professors are more responsive and available because they’re home.

519,jwu4j8,2020-11-19 02:25:52,CollegeRant,Tired of Cheaters Ruining it for the Hard Workers,"Hey all, I hope everyone is hanging in there during this crazy pandemic and doing what they can to survive. I know online classes are absolutely atrocious, but we are all capable of doing anything we set our minds to! Now, on to the rant...

This morning, I had to take a very challenging organic chemistry I exam on Lockdown Browser. This class is notoriously difficult and today’s test was no exception to the rule. The shitty software doesn’t help, but there has always been (historically) a high desire to cheat in this class (according to the professors) so I completely understand why it is used. Pre-COVID, all the orgo sections would have one big exam together at one time that way answers couldn’t be shared between separate exam times.

I spent probably 30+ hours total becoming intimately familiar with this round of material. This part of orgo can’t just be memorized and regurgitated on an exam like some concept-heavy courses, you have to be able to take the basic knowledge and know how to use it throughout a broad set of circumstances and conditions. I won’t go into the details for time’s sake, but it’s hard stuff. It was incredibly frustrating to spend so much time staring at a screen, doing practice problems over and over and over (and over), but I value the knowledge I gained from it and truly felt accomplished when I saw my score of 96/100 when it was said and done. I wish my tale stopped here, but (per the title) it doesn’t. 

I got an email about 4 pm from the chemistry professors saying that efforts to cheat had been discovered on a freaking discord server. I’m not exactly sure how they found out about it since the exam window didn’t close until 9 pm (I don’t know if they can watch the Lockdown Browser videos as the tests are submitted?) but I felt bad for the students. Their academic career is in peril now all over one exam, which sucks a lot. We’re all just trying to make it right now. But then I started to feel disgusted and sad in a different way.

I get that the material is challenging. College is NOT fun most of the time, and now it isn’t fun ever because the social aspect of it has been removed completely thanks to COVID. But there is a certain joy that comes from seeing all your hard work and studying come to fruition. The fact that these students were not prepared enough to honorably sit and take a test without cheating just makes me upset. These are my peers, the very same people I might be sitting next to in medical school in a couple years. And they’re not putting in the effort it takes to actually learn. They’re taking shortcuts, collaborating to cheat, and trying to steal a good grade while completely missing the point of going to college (at least for us STEM majors). Additionally, there are tons of opportunities to get help! Our professors try their hardest to be available (any student can go to any professor), and there are three 1.5 hour long SI sessions every single week. There are practice problems all over the place with check-it-yourself answers. There are prerecorded lectures IN ADDITION to our synchronous Zoom lectures (that are also recorded for later viewing). In my eyes, there is no excuse to not take advantage of these abundant resources and earn at least a passing grade.

Honestly, the whole situation makes those of us who actually earned the score look a lot less credible in these times. We might all have to retake the exam now and for those of us with test anxiety, that blows.

You’re already paying tons of money to learn all the beautiful things about science, why would you just disrespect the process like that? Not to mention a good portion of us in this class have plans to take the MCAT someday—cheating isn’t going to get you very far if you’re trying to get into and through medical school. I guess I just hate the fact that someone who wants to be a doctor (or even a scientist in any sort of way) would cheat like that. I’m just babbling and aimlessly ranting at this point, but thank you A TON if you’ve read this far. I realize I sound like a huge nerd but I am actually passionate about what I’m going to school for. If that shows, so be it.

TL;DR: my peers who I might be sitting next to in medical school someday tried to cheat on an organic chemistry I exam and it made me feel disgusted and sad for those of us who actually tried to learn the material. Now we might have to retake a whole exam a week and a half before finals.",7,4,GreenBeanPie
520,jwoc5y,2020-11-18 21:00:44,CollegeRant,Class Registration - Oh My God,"So I finished my final assignments and exams for my classes. This afternoon I was scheduled to register for spring semester and then I'd be done. But ugh. Here's how it went:

I'm supposed to register at 2 pm. I already know what classes I need to take and I've looked into the professors to have an idea of who I want. I also have been thinking of how I want to format my schedule and plan my classes accordingly, since we're supposed to be in-person next semester. At 1 pm, I sit down to do the final planning when my mom tells me that we have no Internet.

I panic in frustration. I can't get onto any Wifi network and I'm freaking out. I'm considering doing the risky thing of going to a public place to use their Wifi when my dad comes home. He thankfully lets me use his phone as a hotspot so I can still get online, but I'm now behind schedule and it's almost 2 pm.

I manage to figure out the class spots I want and hit submit at 2 pm. Only to get waitlisted for half my classes. I panic again. How is that possible? I email my advisor to figure out if I should risk the waitlist, sign up for different classes altogether, or change professors, and I ended up having to change professors to get these specific classes. It's not the end of the world, but one of the classes is difficult and I was counting on this professor with really good reviews. Oh well. I'm trying not to let it bother me too much, but it's so irritating. It's not like I was irresponsible and procrastinated. I can't believe that the class filled up in 10 seconds. That's not even fair. I have to remind myself that what's important is that I got the credit hours that I needed, but maybe I'm being immature because I didn't get what I wanted (oops).

But side rant. ALL of the classes are online asynchronous. My school pushed us to return to campus next semester with the promise of in-person options. Even online synchronous would have been better. But no. It's all online. I'm not surprised, just disappointed. I just wanted social interaction and to hear professors' tones. I wanted to be able to ask questions in real-time, not over an Email or half-assed tutoring services. I'll be on campus, but with the way these classes are formatted, how am I supposed to make friends? I'm scared I'll have a repeat of this semester where I had no help.

And the whole time I was registering, my parents were rushing me, asking when I was done. I'm glad they were waiting for me to be finished before they shut off the router to fix the Internet, but my mom kept guilt-tripping me because she had work to do too. My dad was irritated because he was being impatient. They didn't understand that I wasn't taking long on purpose. It was that I initially didn't get into the classes I needed to.

I'm still anxious about the classes I registered for. I keep checking to make sure they haven't changed. I keep expecting that the professor I want will open up, but it's unlikely. Yet I'm scared that if I keep clicking on the site, I'll accidentally mess it up. It's a wonderful vicious cycle.

If you've read all of this, wow thank you. If you can't tell, it's been a day.",0,2,Recent-Forever
521,jwfvxw,2020-11-18 13:36:34,CollegeRant,"School wouldn’t block off classes for majors only, almost couldn’t find enough classes to keep my scholarship","So today, I was able to register for classes. Except yesterday, while I was watching the classes for mg major (history), I noticed a trend: a lot of people at the same time were signing up for history classes. The history major is a small one, there aren’t too many history majors in comparison to business or science majors. So this was curious. But there was only one section for each class except the introductory courses, all of which I’ve taken.

Every single history class was full when I went to sign up. Only one class had a short waitlist, everything else was 4-10 people waiting for a class of 19. There was only one section offered for each class. I’m literally on the waitlist for five different classes, all of them for my major or intended major.

So I emailed everyone who could do something about it – advisor, department head, the university president. Across at least five different subjects, there is only one section offered with an increasingly smaller class size.

Like, I get there are covid precautions, but how hard is it to create one section that’s offered online? How hard is it to understand that there are students who might lose their scholarships because they can’t meet minimum hour requirements to be full-time students *because* of this one small section rule? I liked the small classes, but I didn’t really care – I was always at a small high school with small class sizes and they aren’t everything, I actually don’t like them that much.

I am taking three useless classes, and two of the classes I’m signed up for fulfill either a language or fine art credit. I don’t understand why I, a junior history major, was entirely incapable of signing up for any of the history classes",0,2,myglassesaredrty
522,jw29hh,2020-11-17 21:44:04,CollegeRant,I am disappointed in my academic career and not choosing a STEM major,"Hello I am 20F, recently over the last few years I have been disappointed with my academic career. I feel stuck, regretful and depressed. I have always been studious and loved/ valued my education. I come from a very poor, lower working class family so I’m grateful to be born in the Uk and receive free education. 

Since a young kid I was considered ‘gifted and talented’ by the uk education system, I performed really well for my circumstances, I achieved A*A*A*A*A*AABBB for my GCSE’s which is insanely good. These grades are considered even more good when considering the fact I am from a borderline poor family, one of the UK’s most deprived areas and also suffered severe eating disorder from age 14-18. My illness and frequent hospital stays meant I missed huge parts of my education. I went onto college where I really struggled. I was kicked out of home by my now single parent mother. I had to work at least 16 hours a week on minimum wage to afford food and transport to school. I had a really bad relationship with my mum and my mental health was awful. Unfortunately the two years distracted me from studying and I was so angry at myself that I only received AABB a levels, rather than my predicted AAAA. I was devastated as my whole life I wanted to study at kings college London but I didn’t make the grades. I ended up at Queen Mary London, which is still one of the UK’s top 25 unis but nowhere near as prestigious or well known as Kings. I really felt shattered and these are things I hugely regret. Why didn’t i study harder? Why did I have to work? I’m so frustrated at myself.

I’m now studying at my second year of my degree and overall it’s pretty enjoyable although the standard of online learning is quite poor. I performed well for my first year, achieving a first grade which is the highest. Yet now the grades I got this year have been so varied; i legit get either a First grade or a Third grade. I’m so frustrated at myself like why can’t I just achieve well anymore. I’m not even suffering from my mental health as much; in fact I’m in a lot better place than ever. I’m also super regretful that I didn’t chose a STEM subject; I remember in high school forcing myself to do well at math and didn’t enjoy it. Yet now I study it in my spare time I find it much more rewarding than my humanities degree and I am very regretful of my choices. I still love my major a lot, I tend to do well most of the time and I really am passionate about writing essays, I think I’m just annoyed that I know I could’ve given myself a better career path. Especially when my boyfriend is a super talented and intelligent STEM major, I feel inferior / dumb in his presence but I know that’s just me being insecure. I worry about my future as he could easily get a well paying job after he graduates, but it’s not so certain for me. I really want a career in HR or teaching or marketing. 

How can I motivate myself again and how can I feel less insecure about my academic failures.

I took the same class this fall semester ... online thinking I could do it. The professor was great, his assignments and tests are fair. But I just withdrew again after 3 months because I’m doing so poorly.

It’s on me. My motivation has plummeted, I’m not studying, doing my homework or putting in the time and effort I would need to get my desired grade.

Don’t really get how I’m doing ok in my other 2 accounting courses, but unable to even get a passing grade in this one.

Gotta love those FAT two W’s on my transcript and having to get permission from the uni to take this class a third time. 

I guess taking a full course load for Summer and Fall online is catching up to me and burning me out. I’d rather go to school in person than attend ZoOm uNiVerIstY. 

One of these days my heads going to pop off. One of these days...

524,jvw826,2020-11-17 16:39:14,CollegeRant,Enrolled in my classes ~3 weeks ago to only find out it didn't go through and are now closed.,"I am in my third year of college. I had early enrollment the beginning of November, maybe the 3rd. I chose every class I needed with no conflicting times. It was a struggle though. Because of the current circumstances, most classes are online or hybrid with only one teacher teaching at one time. With early enrollment I was happy to easily enroll. I did have a hold on my account stating that I needed to meet with an advisor first before I could enroll. So I did so. I met with my advisor, we talked, and she ensured me that the hold will be gone and I should be good to go for my spring semester classes. Perfect! I thought. I went ahead the next day, made sure that all my classes were in order and I clicked enroll. Great, now I don't have to worry about this until next year. I continue on with my current classes, struggling to get by because I am not an online learner. And about three weeks go by and I get a email with the title of ""**No 2021 Spring Registration**""..... Uhm excuse me? what on earth is this email about? It surely isn't for me since I enrolled...early.... I read and I am confused. I go to my course planner and low and behold... **NO CLASSES**. I have tears in my eyes. I try to go to enroll in them now but to my luck, they are all closed. The lady who sent me an email told me it was because I had a hold on my account to meet with an advisor.... COME ON. I did that. I did everything I need to do. And it is still not enough. Can I just waitlist and see if anyone drops the courses I need for my major? Yeah, I can. But remember, a lot of students have a Biology major. A lot of students (+200) need cell biology lab and organic chemistry. But there is **ONLY** **ONE** class at one given time for the spring semester. the likely hood of someone dropping those courses before it starts is extremely low. Students might drop it close to midterm. But I can't join that far into the semester. I do not want to take a semester off. But it would cost more money in the long run if I took whatever I could this spring. I want to graduate on time. I don't want to pay more money. This year sucks and it's only getting worse. There is nothing I can do.

Please tell me that someone else is in the same boat as me.....

525,jv419u,2020-11-16 09:34:07,CollegeRant,i'm so frustrated with my prof.,"one of my professors is going through some hard times right now. i feel really bad for him, especially because of circumstances he has to deal with, but i (and a lot of my classmates) wish he took a break. online school has been something that's been super difficult to adapt to for everyone but it seems like he's really struggling with it. it definitely shows in his teaching.

maybe he can't afford to take time off - i understand that and i am not judging him if that is the case. but it is insanely frustrating paying for a professor who always goes on tangents for so long that no one knows when he's back to the course material. whose review classes for tests don't actually review anything and just leave you more confused than before. where your grades are literally from two midterms and one final so if you fuck up any of those you fail the fucking class.

 i feel like such an asshole for saying this stuff but idk yall, he's not the one who needs these classes to get a degree, you know? ugh. what tops it off is that we can't complain about it to the chair because he IS the chair. i can't wait until this covid fuckery is over. :(",0,3,kindofabitche

527,jum3bs,2020-11-15 13:45:56,CollegeRant,Weird meme about my thoughts for completely asynchronous online learning,"As soon as COVID-19 hit the country for my 1st year of college lots of people told me that online classes for my 1st semester would be easy. But as soon as classes started I knew it would be bad. Too many long papers and essays to do (most feel unnecessary and excessive). Too many modules and reading materials. Requirements that need us to go out and risk getting infected. Little to no clarifications and explanations for modules. Clarifications with professors are difficult. A very unengaging and buggy online management system for learning. The anxiety of not seeing a requirement in the learning system. The anxiety of seeing all your requirements at once. Honestly, I am not sure if what I feel is valid. Maybe college really has this much requirements and readings with almost no breathing room. Maybe I am just irresponsible enough to miss some announcements and deadlines. This is also my first time dealing with online classes and I just made this weird meme to let out my thoughts (the format is odd and kinda ugly).

The teacher does not curve, he marks points off of EVERY assignment for the stupidest, smallest shit. I’ve complained to compliance and they don’t do anything to him- I went online and read his reviews and apparently it’s a VERY common issue with this teacher in particular. He has failed the majority of his students by what I can tell.

We can see our class average as well for our overall grade and that’s showing as a 56, and I have a mid-C. My grade also shows as the “high” in the class so I know no one has a higher grade than mine (but may be equal to). 

Like, I don’t get why some teachers are this much of stick in the muds. They have got to realize that nobody likes them and that they are full of shit if they expect perfection on each and every thing and mark off a massive amount of points for small things. What does that accomplish? Literally nothing? What does intentionally creating the hardest test you can accomplish? Literally nothing.

College is supposed to be about learning material, not competing to see who can make their course the hardest and most ridiculous.  

And we pay for this crap...

529,juc0jb,2020-11-14 23:53:30,CollegeRant,This semester has been full of shitty professors!!,"This semester has been awful and full of awful professors.

I have my math professor that is actually pretty decent at teaching but hasn’t graded the majority of my assignments. Do I know if I need to try harder....no. Do I know if I am passing the class....no. Do I know if I understand the material...NO! (I’m also salty about the fact we can’t have notes on exams but that’s a me problem) 

Next I have one of my education professors who was grading pretty decently and I quite enjoyed doing her assignments, until I had to do classroom observations and write papers about them. I had a 95 in the class before this mind you. She essentially told us to find out own classroom to observe. She expected us to do this in one week in the middle of a pandemic. I wouldn’t be so mad if she had given us time before hand. This is an online class so I didnt expect her to find them for us like my other professor did. Then when it came to writing papers on our experiences all the sudden became the most picky teacher ON PLANET EARTH. My grade went from a 95 to a 87 after two assignments. 

And last I have my environmental science teacher who has been lazy from day one. Need help in an assignment, well don’t expect an email back until the day it is due. Want a study guide for a mid term that could define your grade, nope, make sure to study 20 hours worth of video material! And as for notes in the mid term, make sure you cram all the information on a tiny 5X3 note card! Oh yeah not to mention the questions in the mid term were incredibly specific and the class average was a 50%!

I have one class that I enjoy because I have a great professor in that class. The only issue I’ve had with her is the amount of group assignments she’s made us do.

I’ve lost all motivation for this semester and it’s ALL because my professors are lazy and won’t help us through a fricking PANDEMIC!!",1,1,GabbyTheLegend
530,ju170c,2020-11-14 12:26:24,CollegeRant,College and coronavirus is making my life a living hell,"I think I'm going insane lately trying to keep up with my education.

I'm falling behind in every single class/subject since I have undiagnosed ADD, but adderall is illegal in my country so i just gotta push trough it. So i study everyday from 8AM to 10pm, about 14 hours daily either with classes in between or on weekends without stopping, that's the only way I can focus. 

I eat only once a day very late at night so i can avoid making unnecesary interruptions, still I'm falling behind and i feel there's no time to breathe.

I'm stuck in a college far from my house and live in a dorm with shared bathroom and kitchen, this has done wonders for my social anxiety forcing me to go shower at 1AM to avoid other people. My roommate is also loud and constantly playing games / chatting with people so i'm barely able to study in my room.

Meanwhile most of our classes are online and we are forced to turn on our cameras, and i just can't focus with my camera on, i swear i've tried but i'm unable to. It is worse during exams, where i feel even more nervous. I failed two exams already due to nerves and i knew the stuff but i couldn't do it in the little time we had.

Even worse, my family is going through finnancial hardships over corona, and i can't afford a laptop, leaving me with an extremely old intel celeron one that lasts 20 minutes without being connected to battery, so i can't even bring it to class. 

And the wifi in our dorm is so bad you can't stream anything, and they block most websites like steam, netflix and all vpn sites so you can't even download a vpn.

 I stopped being able to do all the things that brought me joy like playing games, making music.. watching movies, i have zero distractions and nothing to do but study from morning to night. Not that i would have any time if i could anyways. 

I also have no friends, since it's impossible to make friends with social anxiety and a freaking pandemic where you can't even go out. 

Group assignments are the worst, and the best part is the score you get is divided by all members of the group, and they're not fixed size. That means you end up alone and rejected and people have a valid reason to ostracize you even further.

 I cry myself to sleep everynight and pray to some god to give me the virus and let me die already. But i can't fail, not again, so i get up everyday regardless and keep trying. I don't know for how long.",1,1,throwmeaway28383383

My biochemistry professor decided to make his class “flipped classroom” this semester, but his definition of that is “come ask questions in class and teach yourself everything prior from the textbook”— aka, we don’t have lectures. So I taught myself from the textbook until now and eventually stopped attending zoom (I wasn’t paying attention anyway), but I went today to check in and he said starting this week everything being taught is not in the textbook and we should take notes. He also doesn’t record his lectures because he doesn’t want to and he thinks we will actually show up, but already less than half the class shows up (not shocking). I’m very frustrated and I can’t focus on this class that I now NEED to focus on since I can’t go back to recordings, and the slides he talks off of are incredibly vague. This whole class has been a mess online, it is comprised of two merged sections with two professors so we keep switching back and forth between them, but I can’t focus on either. I have the second of 3 exams tomorrow and I got an A on the first one, but for this next one I feel really behind and frustrated and stressed. The second exam is the second professors material while the first exam was the first professors material, so I don’t even know what to expect, and the third is going to be a hybrid of the two? This way of school, while inevitable, is just not for me.

TL:DR, my biochem professor suddenly switched from us teaching ourselves everything to “this material isn’t in your textbook” and I can’t focus on his not-recorded lectures, and it’s just very stressful.",0,1,PatheticCarrot

I'm usually a pretty good student, I was initially attending CSUN and I was eligible for their honors program which I intended to be in. But I withdrew my admission from the university like many students in my grade because paying money for online classes wasn't worth it. I'm getting free tuition for 2 years at city college and I planned to aim higher than CSUN and transfer to a better school like USC or UCLA. But I really underestimated college. I've been struggling with ADHD and depression and it's difficult staying motivated and on top of everything when its all online and I know millions of other students are silently suffering academically as well. I also felt like I was thrown into college without any idea of how anything works. I feel like I never get the memo about anything. I met with my Academic Counselor to plan classes but now I cant meet with her again cause she's fully booked for the rest of the year. I didn't even know there was a deadline to withdraw from classes (which has passed btw) and I'm drowning in missing work and finals are in December. I'm panicking. I guess USC or UCLA is out of the question. But now I don't know what my options are and if I'll ever be able to transfer to a good school because of how much I fucked up my first semester. I have an A in my freshman seminar class, a B in my english class, and I'm months behind in my history and philosophy class so you can probably guess what grade I have in those classes. The cherry on top of it all is I'm taking this history class for the 2nd time now cause I failed it the first time when I tried to take it in high school. I'm too scared to meet with my professors because of how far behind I am. I wish I could've just taken a gap semester or something so I could've figured out what I really wanted to major in and what I career I wanted to pursue. Now I don't know if I'll ever be able to succeed in life now that I'm gonna have this on my permanent record. I plan to work harder next semester and stay on top of everything now that I understand what college is like and how seriously I'm supposed to take it. But what can I do now???

536,jsl11j,2020-11-12 01:13:18,CollegeRant,Online Schooling is tough. And it is starting to cost me one of my courses. What are your thoughts on Online Schooling?," So, as you read in the title, I am here to talk about Online Schooling and what other people think about it. In all honesty, it's more like a rant. I am not doing too well in one of my courses, a Financial Accounting course. My homeworks are amazing, but the exams are hell. I am having difficulty memorizing how to set up the Balance Sheets, Income Statements, Note Receivable, etc. and it feels like it's my fault. Don't get me wrong, I studied hard for that exam, but now it feels like it was a waste of time.

The exam is questionable to say the least. All of our homework is done on Pearson (fuck pearson) and, well, the exams are not. They are all done on D2L and it comes in two parts. The first part is a list of multiple choice questions. They are not that hard, and I felt like most of my studying previously helped me through that. The only odd thing about this part is that you can't go back to a previous question. You literally go through each question separately without the ability to go back. It was the first time I've encountered this in ANY exam I've had.

Part two is the bitch of the two. It's a Word file that you have to download and work on, then upload it to D2L. This part is what contains the Balance Sheet and whatever else I said earlier. In all of my past three exams, I've never done good on this part.

The thing that is weird about all of this is why are we not doing all of this on Pearson? I've pain for the damn access key, so why isn't it being used for the entire course, rather than just the homeworks. In previous accounting courses, I've had tests that had both the Multiple choice questions and the bigger problems. I seriously don't understand why our instructor does the same. Wouldn't it automatically be graded upon submission just like all of my previous exams in other accounting courses?

It's a pain in the ass and I can't really do much about it. I had to take an online course so that I can watch my sister, as her school, like most, transferred over to online schooling. I've done mostly well in any of my college courses and gained a associates degree because of it, but this is the first time it's actually becoming too difficult. This has been the most difficult class to study for. I wish that we were not in a pandemic and were forced to choose between staying at home, or risking going to a campus to possibly find some fucking idiots not wearing a mask and become at risk of catching this plague. (Quick note, if you wear a mask upon going out anywhere in public, thank you for keeping yourself safe, your family safe, and the people that you past safe.)

But on tuesday, I had my final class meeting with some of my professors because finals are next week. And in one of my classes, my professor was all like "" I hope you enjoyed this semester, and I would've liked to meet you in person because I would always enjoy taking with you and discussing different things"".  This professor is pretty well known for students in my major and everybody loves him and when I heard him say that I thought on what a waste of an opportunity this semester has been to meet new people and stuff.

It’s an afternoon class (online) but it’s stupid because on the day she set for this exam, some students have other classes on that day or work.

Other students explained to her they have classes/work on the day she scheduled our exam. 

And for some fucking reason, that annoyed her because now she has to change the exam a little for some of these students so they can take it on a Tuesday.

I didn't learn anything this semester. I commited the awful mistake of not paying attention the first two classes of calculus and physics, and then when I tried to listen on the next class everything was super confusing, and I didn't want to ask the teacher because college teachers don't have any patience.

Since then in all the tests and homeworks I just cheated. In physics was easy, thanks to the teacher-free whatsapp group chat in which we share all the answers. Calculus was a little tricky but Photomath and Symbiolab gave me everything I needed. I need to point out that this was all posible because of the online classes, if I was physically on classroom, this kind of cheating wouldn't be possible, and I probably would've payed more attention.

But why? Why would I do such thing? Because of an ultimatum. Before this semester my dad came to me and said ""If you withdraw, I will not pay for college anymore"".

541,jrpef3,2020-11-10 17:36:32,CollegeRant,Ranting about school and breaking down,"So, I'm sure the overwhelming majority of us aren't doing well. However I just need to rant about a few of my classes because my mental health isn't doing great.

I'm taking a biology class and a lab right now (3 credit hours). This professor does not teach at all. We are expected to do a text book reading and read over his 80+ slide power points. It takes me hours to read and take notes on the information, and I'm not retaining any of it. I truly have learned nothing from this course and it is absolutely mind numbing and draining to sit at my laptop all day and read and take notes. There is no further instruction for this class and this doesn't even include the time for the weekly quizzes, assignments, and studying. 

I am taking a kinesiology class too (3 credit hours). This professor changed her zoom time during my lab so I cannot attend. I read over her power points and take notes, however her powerpoints are poorly organized and lack a lot of information. They do not record the zoom meetings, although I've heard that they aren't much help either. We have also been assigned multiple group projects, even though this class is 100% online, and the majority of us aren't on or near campus. These projects have all required us to meet somehow and take recordings. It's just frustrating that we are in a pandemic and they didn't modify the projects where we wouldn't have to meet. 

And am taking an art integration class (1 credit hour). Despite this class only being 1 credit hour, I have the most work for this class. His assignments are extremely confusing and he does not give a lesson during his zoom meetings. Everyone in the class is overwhelmed with the amount of work we have and we're all confused on practically every assignment. This week I have 4 different readings to complete, I have to watch several long videos (45+ minutes), we've had papers due every week, we have to go and explore 10+  articles (more readings) as part of the lesson to teach ourselves, and more. 

As I said, my mental health isn't doing great. I've been having a really hard time getting out of bed and trying to get motivated to do work. I'm still taking 2 other classes and have separate assignments and exams for the lab. I'm extremely stressed and overwhelmed. School doesn't feel real right now and I honestly haven't learned a thing all semester. Most of these classes have very obviously not been changed for an online format. It seems as if these professors aren't even attempting to teach, I only have one that gives consistent lectures. It's just really frustrating as it seems like they don't care/aren't aware that we all have multiple other classes and many of us have started working full time hours during this time. I am completely burnt out and I'm ready for the semester to end. Sorry for the rant, thanks to anyone who read this far lol.

TL:DR

Basically, my professors are assigning an absurd amount of work online, the classes don't seem modified for online learning, I have group projects that require us to meet, I'm burnt out and my mental health is declining quickly. I truthfully haven't learned a thing. All my classes are online next semester as well so it doesn't look like it's getting any better.",3,1,nicolee1220

I am 18, living on my own first time, junior. Took statistics previously and passed with an 89.98%. Transfered schools. New school told me I have to take stats again bc it wasn't the exact specific type of statistics they want me to take. Cue hell.

I think I have one of the worst professors in the world. I have been trying to stay away from coming to class if I can avoid it, as I am extremely cautious about COVID. My dad had me on a very tight chain during lockdown and I intend to keep myself on that chain if it means I don't get sick or get my loved ones sick. My stats professor told me I could do the class online and do the quizzes online as well. For the first TEST she required us to come in. Class proceeded to get less than 70% average. I told the professor I would really rather do class online as I teach myself better. Cue her telling me that unless I test positive, I have to come to class (against school policy this semester). When I told her that I will 100% fail this class if I have to do it in the in person format, and that I am more comfortable academically and safety wise doing it online, she told me to just drop the class. I've tried to compromise with her but it's just ridiculous.

She doesn't even make her own material. She uses YouTube videos made by other professors. When she does make her own material, I feel like I'm listening to someone speak to me in a foreign language, because she never explains anything at all. She has us teach ourselves and then do all the tests in person. And by God, she has the most grating voice in the world.

The textbook? Written by her husband.

She doesn't respond to emails EVER. 

Her in person lectures is her making jokes and laughing awkwardly when everyone sits there in silence. 

I can't go to the Dean of Stats about her awful *everything* because he is her husband.

I went to the Dean of SA and never got a response. Now I'm jumping through hoops with the Psych and Gen Ed departments to try and get my previous Stats class to count as credit. And what do they do? Put me in limbo. I'm ready to rip my hair out waiting.

I'm probably forgetting more but oh well.

I'm just so tired. I don't know if it's because of everything going on... COVID, politics, new home life, all online... Or if it's teachers assigning a fuck ton of work. Or it's because all of my classes (except, ironically, the stats class, which is a 100 level) are 300 level.

 But back to my main point.

I can't focus anymore, I really can't. I feel awful about this stats class. I refuse to come to class because I have problems bending to authority, and I don't want her to ""win"". The Dean of SA has left me hanging even though she's breaking school policies. The worst part is that I *will fail this class*. I'm missing quizzes. I don't come to lecture because I hate her and this class so much. I just want to smack her upside the head and tell her how stupid she is. How did she even get a PhD? Like, fuck. How many dicks did you suck to get your degree? Apologies for the language, but she's so God awful. I should have listened to Rate My Professor. I saw her awful reviews, and my gut told me to drop, but my mom said I should give her a chance, as I have had professors that everyone else hates that I have adored.

I feel like I've let my dad down. I work so hard to make him happy. He's really hard to please. But I've basically thrown out 1.4k of his money because I have no desire to go to this class anymore. I told him I'm going to pay him back, and he said he just wants me to pass, which I know I can't do. I can't let him just waste his money like that. I feel garbage. My brother is disappointed in me, because he thinks dropping is the easy way out. My mom is a lot more understanding, but she thinks that I can still pass regardless. I just hate it here. I hate it. I'm spending every moment of every day stressing out about the limbo that the psych and gen Ed departments have me in that I'm not even getting my work done. I'm doing the bare minimum. 

I feel like a failure. I get so stressed, and then I do nothing but eat, and then gain weight (my biggest fear), so that just adds onto the stress. I feel like I'm in Hell. I'm stressing about doing grad school when I'm older. I'm stressing about not having a job, even though I don't have time for one because I have so much school. I feel stressed even when I tell myself to relax. I can't enjoy weekends anymore. I don't know what to do. I hate myself for giving up on this class. I just can't do it anymore. I don't know why I'm failing. It's just. So. Confusing. I did awesome in my last class. But now I'm just doing terribly and it seems like everyone else is too. I just want to go to sleep and not wake up for weeks.

 I don't know what to do.

545,jqchu6,2020-11-08 14:22:29,CollegeRant,"Professor refusing to give marks for a test, saying that I copied it all from her notes","I'm a freshman. For my first General English online test, my professor provided some reference notes written by students in earlier years, and said that we can refer to a few points from those notes and write our test. I briefly read through it but decided to refer to my own notes that I wrote during class, which was being taught by another professor.

A few days ago, I got a feedback email from her saying that I had copied everything from her notes and so I wouldn't be getting (any/sufficient) marks. 
... 
I was confused so I went back, did a side-by-side comparison of her notes and my written test... nothing is copied, not even by accident. I would understand if I had copied complete sentences but I didn't, also, if she sent reference notes, isn't it obvious that we are gonna take some pointers from her? How are we supposed to come up with subjective answers to prose/poetry that is, to some extent, objective?

I sent an email back to her, politely asking her to reevaluate my test which I think was unfairly graded, along with screenshots of my own notes that coincide with what I wrote for the test. However, she mentioned in class that she won't be going through her emails cause she's too ""busy"" and she's also the kind of character who lashes out at students who question her in any way. So...

This was more of a rant cause I don't think there's any solution unless she agrees to reevaluate but... chances of that are slim. I just think it was very unfair and I'm afraid that she will continue to do this for future tests and refuse to even acknowledge proof of originality. I'm just a bit frustrated. I really hope she won't be the only one grading our tests.

546,jo0hqi,2020-11-04 17:09:22,CollegeRant,My advisor doesn't seem to realize I can pick my classes early and is virtually unreachable at all times.,"I have a documented disability with my disability resource office and one of the ""perks"" that gives me is being able to lock in classes for the next semester on the first day it opens. My advisor doesn't seem to realize that and with the way we have to pick up our PIN Numbers, we have to have a face to face meeting with them, but my advisor doesn't have any dates open until NEXT Wednesday, when it is the sophomore's turn to lock in classes. This is usually fine, except for the fact that I am a dual graduate/undergrad student, a class of people who usually gets to pick classes on the first or second day of it opening which means that by the time I get my PIN I'll have no grad classes to pick from for my major. This has also been happening EVERY semester since I joined the school as a freshmen, every time I am allowed to lock in classes I seem to get in that face to face meeting late because my advisor never states when he is open for appointments, and the one email he sends out about it gets lost in a sea of other emails, the dates that the openings are on is one piece of paper that he emails to us once and expects us to rememeber, he emails no other reminders or anything, so if we miss it then we're fucked.

 I realize as a college student it is up to me to be on-top of shit, and I am, except this is also an advisor that doesn't read his email and actually deletes emails because he ""Doesn't like the way they are formatted."" What the fuck does that mean? He doesn't like the way they are formatted, yet doesn't clearly state, anywhere, on the format he wants you to use, the only time you get to see the format he wants you to use is if you have him as a teacher. 

Last semester, I had to basically chain email what amounted to the entire administration that concerned student registration because the PIN number he gave me was for LAST spring, not this spring semester and classes were already open and getting filled up almost faster than I could send emails, when I tried to tell the person that fixed that on the phone, they tried to guilt-trip me and said that my advisor should really have been doing this? Why would I be calling them if my advisor could do his job? Then it was a race to get the classes I actually needed instead of filler classes that would mean nothing whatsoever for either of my degrees. I cannot afford to take a semester off time-wise as I only have 2 years to finish the grad portion of the dual program, and I shouldn't really have to. He barely has any availability when he does post his advising appointments and they get taken up faster than I can put an appointment in, he basically has more students than availability because he is the advisor for everyone that isn't the normal grad program or a transfer. He's basically useless and I'm not sure what to do but I don't want to be fucked because he can't do his job. Switching advisors at this point would be the game plan, but I'm worried about this next semester of classes especially concerning the fact we will still be online most likely. I seriously don't know what to do and the fact that he has done this consistently is seriously making me consider doing a ADA non-compliance complaint to the government because it's bordering on seriously inaccessible. I shouldn't have to be locked out of classes because he doesn't clearly state anything, and I shouldn't have to be locked out of classes because he is virtually unreachable at any given time, even when the email I'm sending is the equivalent of life and death for my academic career.",0,1,cat4hurricane

548,jnj2u5,2020-11-03 21:18:24,CollegeRant,A Dual Enrollment student's rant on cheating in online open note/book quizzes,"Why do others feel the need to cheat on open book quizzes? It's an open book quiz. You have access to ALL OF THE MATERIALS. This will likely just be the textbook that the professor follows word for word, but you can use it. How great is that? Unless the materials have some confusing wording, you're pretty much guaranteed to get 100%. Now, I'm only a dual enrollment student, but I'm pretty sure these type of quizzes don't happen that often. Now to whoever has these types of quizzes, how much of a help is it Of? To not have to memorize 10-20 pages? I'll answer that. It's pretty fucking helpful. 

Of course, a lot of students do use their materials and get it done. But then you have tweedle dee and tweedle dumbass who decide to send a message, IN THE GOD DAMN GROUP CHAT that they want to work together with someone on the quiz. Yeah, not the smartest people. And do you know what happens when this occurs? Oh nothing, except NOW EVERYONE WILL HAVE 20 QUESTIONS REQUIRING A PARAGRAPH FOR EACH ANSWER.

I was sick of classmates ruining things for others in elementary and middle school, and was shocked to have to deal with it in high-school. BUT DO THESE KIND OF PEOPLE JUST NOT GROW THE FUCK UP? Like as I said before, you have access to all your materials. YOU SHOULD GET AN 'A' ON THESE THINGS! DO YOU SERIOUSLY NEED THE HELP OF OTHER PEOPLE? ARE YOU THAT LAZY TO NOT LOOK SOMETHING UP IN THE BOOK? Every time I think about these types of people I just get a headache. It's like they're handed something on a silver platter, and then say something like ""But I wanted a gold platter!"" or some other ridiculous nonsense like that.

549,jng9zb,2020-11-03 18:52:26,CollegeRant,Getting taken for the most scummiest and expensive ride of my life.,"I am going to apologize in advance, but I need to get this off my chest.

While I currently have all A's in my courses, this semester has been like no other. I will say right off the bat I am not satisfied with this semester.

We are paying the same amount as we would if the classes were In-Person, and frankly, the experience I have received this semester is not worth what was paid for it.

I have six courses this semester and 5 of them have all been online, with the other once a week in-person. Do not get me wrong, I do not hate online courses. Some of them can be really rewarding. I am currently a Senior and took my first online course last spring, and honestly, it was one of the best and more interesting classes I've taken thus far. But that is because the teacher was engaged, tried, and taught us.

Some teachers have us watch pre-recorded lectures, which is also fine. However, the date on most of these lectures was recorded for when we went out on COVID in the spring or for the summer semester and are simply being reused. I find this fairly lazy and feel like the professors are not being as involved as they should be/would be in a typical face-to-face semester.

Some of my classes have Zoom meetings at a specific time, and that is fine. At least they are trying to be engaged with us.

However, I have a couple of teachers that just boast a Module Document, with a bunch of links to Youtube Videos and Websites and tell us to watch and read them and then do an activity based on them. This is where I draw the line. Students are paying thousands upon thousands of dollars for tuition and you are just linking some websites and YouTube videos, I could otherwise search up and find myself?? This has got to be some of the laziest, non-engaging experience I have ever had in school.

I am studying to become a High School Teacher. In a typical semester, we are typically assigned a public school and a teacher and we are to observe anywhere from 25-35 hours of that teacher's class. Of course, due to COVID this is not possible. So the substitute for this problem has been to watch hours upon hours of teaching videos on various websites, like YouTube. I have even had a teacher suggest that we go out and APPLY to become substitutes at the local schools to get the experience. I am sorry, but this is just crazy. I feel like I am getting jipped.

Lastly, I am a commuting student. I have never lived on campus, I always drive to campus. My college charges anywhere from **$500-$750** for a parking permit PER semester. We were forced to sign up and pay for these parking permits back in early July before we knew whether to not the classes we signed up for would be face-to-face or online. We always have to sign up and pay for these permits to ensure that we get one, because in a typical semester finding parking is a huge hassle. Needless to say, August rolls around and the start of face-to-face classes are pushed back two weeks. So they refunded. a whopping **30 bucks** on my $550 parking permit. Professors were given the option to keep their class online and that is what 5 of my 6 professors decided to do.

However, there were no refunds for the permit as we were already 3 weeks into the semester. I would only use about **SIX** times this semester. So essentially **3 hours of parking ONCE a week** ended up costing me around **$87 dollars each time**.

So to close, yes, I do feel like I have gotten taken for one hell of a scummy and expensive ride this semester. I do not feel like I have gained anything other than credits this semester.",1,1,bub465
550,jnfmua,2020-11-03 18:20:07,CollegeRant,Half of my professors are shit,"This is my 3rd full semester in school (2 summer semesters thrown in there) since going back early 2019. So far, I have had a decent experience. I like online classes for easy courses because I can do the work at my own pace. But this is the first semester I signed up for in person classes because I knew I would need in person instruction (Stats mainly).

Holy shit, I can not get past how much my professors this semester are dropping the ball. I am taking 18 hours, 6 in person, 12 online. 3 of my online courses are fine and the teachers are always on schedule, open up assignments on time, grade things hastily. But my 2 in person classes and 1 of my online classes, the professors are so bad I feel like I've gone crazy.

My stats professor just reads the PowerPoint, and doesn't seem to understand that needs to break things down. He is constantly behind the curve on navigating BB and opening assignments, we have to e-mail him when something has gone awry, and whenever someone asks him a question he has no idea how to answer it without using technical jargon. Some classes he will just play Khan Academy videos. I get that Khan academy is a great resource, but it's solely how I am learning stats this year.

My Accounting professor is so damn scatterbrained and it's clear that teaching is not a priority for her this year. She has cancelled 2 classes already and moved a test back, because, and this is not a joke, she had some issues with her other business. What if I decided I was going to take a test next week because my small business had a fire I needed to put out? I understand that she is the one running the class, but how fucking rude. I am paying for a product. She is also another PowerPoint reader, and it's very clear that she rushes through the slides to get out of the classroom. She recently moved ANOTHER test back this week and assigned the chapter after the test for this week, which throws off the entire rhythm of the class.

The last of the bunch is a buscom professor. Now, this class is very easy, or at least it should be if the professor knew at all how to work blackboard and open up assignments on time. She posts broken links, post sign up sheets that don't let people sign up due to a technical error, and then doesn't respond to her e-mails. In an online class you don't have much contact with other students, so I thought perhaps I was perceiving things wrong, but she actually posted an apology video to the class for being AWOL. She went to the fucking mountains to get away one week while students were contacting each other about an impending due date.

Maybe I am an asshole, but I think the professors are using COVID as an excuse. Because they all keep saying ""it's a crazy year, just bear with me"". But the thing is, it's a crazy year for everyone. I'm not slacking on my assignments, I make my schedule every week and stick to it, and I don't expect people to be lenient with me.

I fully expect people to tell me to chill out, but I need to vent. This is the first semester that I feel as though I am getting ripped off. Not to mention the fact that all the important networking events were moved online, which I get, but I didn't get a tuition reduction for this. I get it's crazy, and I expect some turmoil and uncertainty, but this is insane.",0,1,Odysseus32

I hate how Professors give us a short amount of time to do our online tests to prevent cheating but also load up on the questions thinking you’ll be able to finish those too.

I hate how Professors most of the time just upload a recorded lecture or shitty narrated power
points, and when you ask them a question they tell you to read the book or go over the recordings so you’re practically just teaching yourself.

I hate how I absolutely cannot focus during ‘zoom’ calls or find the motivation to do my assignments and sit my ass down and study.

I just can’t pay attention on zoom. It feels like I’ve learned nothing this semester. I’ve tried everything. Snacks, water, keeping my phone under my bed. I even locked myself in my closet for one class so I wouldn’t have any distractions. And I just watched the shirts on the hangers. I couldn’t do it. 

My school has no universal online school work policy (I don’t know if other schools have guidelines, but our professors are left to their own devices). And many professors have been making supplementary assignments to make up for classes not being in person. 

I’ve been missing assignments because we have many supplementary online assignments. Discussion boards, voice recordings, peer reviews, and things we normally wouldn’t be doing during the semester on top of what we would normally be doing in a semester. I’ve got Bs and Cs but that’s not enough to keep my scholarship. 

We have had no set midterm week. So I have been doing midterms, supplementary midterm assignments, and draft assignments since September. Now we’ve moved into finals. I’m screaming. I’ve gotten no breaks. I had 4 mid to large scale assignments due on Halloween. 


I’m so burnt out. I’m struggling to keep up. On top of this I have a puppy, part time work, and an internship. I cry literally every night. I feel as if my time is not my own. My hair is falling out. It feels like everyone else gets this online school more than me and I hate feeling this way. I’m so so far behind. 

So please. I could use some encouragement. Some de-stressing tips. Some empathy. Anything. My support systems have been mostly unhelpful.

554,jk05n7,2020-10-29 00:39:50,CollegeRant,Switching Majors,"TL;DR I'm currently a second yr. biology major and I'm considering switching majors.

Ok well... I love biology and anatomy, and science itself. But I'm failing my last gen chem class because I took the other first two gen chem classes online over the summer and I did NOT learn anything. I didn't take AP chem in HS, I took regular chem sophmore yr hs so I really don't know ANYTHING about chemistry. I struggle HARD with math, I'm currently in calculus and like I said before I really have no idea what's going on. After this class I have one more calc class then I'll never have to take another one again but I will have to take physics LMAO.

Although I'm almost done with these gen ed science classes, I still have to do OCHEM and Physics... before I get to the upper div classes. I'm not sure if I'll be able to make it through them and pass with good enough grades/ pass at all.

SO you're probably thinking dam this person rlly is not good at anything... its true I say the same, but I am taking a gen bio class rn and I love it, I'm getting good grades and I'm excited to learn more from that class. The only reason I chose to be biology major is because I do love learning about biology and human anatomy and I want to help people, like really help them and see that I'm making a difference in their lives. I know that if I do ever get to the Biology upper div classes, I'll pass with flying colors and actually be happy with what I'm doing. But I won't get the chance to make it if I don't pass the other science gen ed classes and I'm not sure it going through all that pain and struggle/ downgrade of my GPA is worth it.

I think if I did switch my major I'd want to be a business admin major with a concentration in marketing. My college doesn't have a marketing major so this will have to do. I really like marketing and I'd love to learn more about it and even pursue it as a career. I would want to use this to work with something in the media and/or film. My actual dream job is to be an actor (which I know is really hard and super competitive but).

I'm still considering to stay as biology major because I don't want to give up too early and think I could've pass those classes if I tried a little harder. But I don't want to waste my time on something that won't end up benefitting my future and will just give me more anxiety.

I'm still unsure if I want to become a doctor in the future but I think I would enjoy it as a career, but I'd have to stick to my studies and get through med school and more. I'd be completely fine with a business corporate job too.

555,jjhmfe,2020-10-28 04:52:13,CollegeRant,Some professors are finding ways to make this online stuff annoying,"Please excuse me if you think I’m being a bit dramatic. 

I have a class where it’s being co-taught by two professors. I’m only assigned to and graded by one of the professors but I’m receiving lectures and emails from both. I. Am. Exhausted.

They keep posting folders upon folders of new material every day and their exams are “write 2-4 paragraphs about parts a-z” in 90 minutes. 

The class is asynchronous but they do these zoom meetings, right before exams, to go over the material and get questions asked in live time. They blow up our notifications with announcements about it. The meetings are not mandatory but since the first exam, they keep throwing shade at people and saying that people who don’t attend, don’t do so well. I made a 98 on the last exam and didn’t attend but I understand if I’m just one of the outliers to the chart they made. (They literally made a chart) 

There’s another exam coming up and I’ve signed up for this one cause I’m curious at this point. But now I don’t trust them. They just posted an exam review video and there’s two things I noticed:

1) they only shouted out people who attended the live meetings. (It’s weird to me how you keep saying you understand that people can’t attend spontaneous live class meetings and yet keep telling us that people who don’t, don’t do as well as the people who do. They don’t record it either so like please shut the fuck up. 

2) they said that there were many people who answered one particular question wrong. They still gave us the points for it and they even admitted that it was wrong technically by THEIR standards... but I’m really skeptic of them now. I had to find that answer (and many answers from the study guide) in the textbook because they definitely didn’t go over it in any of their lectures. The professor even asked for reassurance from the other professor to feel backed up and it just made me cringe.

Edit: And this one girl in the Group Me just kind of pissed me off. She tried to put me and this other person on blast talking about “literally don’t stress out. The professors are nice”. First off, I’m not stressing out and at least not purposely. But if the professors are throwing shade at us for stuff THEY haven’t taught, excuse me if I think that’s a problem. Second, they could be the nicest people in the world...they still need to completely do their jobs. Third, these folks keep Kiki-ing about how they don’t have the textbook and only watch the lectures and still did good. I didn’t say this in the chat, but I have the textbook and did way better than them sooooo huh 🤔 .

I got myself a car for commuting and enrolled in computer science since I thought I'd enjoy it. My professor is horrible and it was too late before I figured it out. He has a whopping 2.3/5 stars and every review for him in my class says he's awful. I can see why, he caters to kids with experience and assigns way too much homework in some online textbook which we're supposed to learn everything from. Anyways long story short I'm sitting here not understanding anything stressed out of my mind and seriously considering dropping the class for a 'W'. I know this is what college is for, but I see my friends having the time of their lives, going to parties and barely doing any work for CS among other things while I'm here in my basement stressing over this crap. The obvious choice would be to withdraw before the deadline since this really isn't for me and I was only enticed by the potential salary and try something else, but I don't know what I even want to do. I've always liked cars, so I'd like to do something that could get me a job as an automotive engineer somewhere down the line, but at the same time what if I like computer science and this professor just sucks? I'm already failing so I think it's best to probably cut my losses. Sorry for the rant, but please help me.",3,1,StickShiftAnimal

How are you going to assign an international project during covid and ONLINE! WITH NO CRITERIA!,"Dude this business communications class has been the death of me. Of all the hard classes I'm in for finance and such its this bullshit class that I have the most work. My teacher? She's actually dumb. Her and this German school decided it would be a good idea to assign a bullshit international online project for the very first time to us students and has not provided any sort of instructions or clear rubric as to what needs to be done and has required us to try and find actual professionals who are currently working in our desired fields to find time and sit down for an interview with us from both germany and the US. Then make some sort of bullshit project based on that but the kicker? THEY LITERALLY DONT HAVE ANY SHEETS LIKE AT ALL On what they want done. They literally find themselves not knowing what to do half the time or they're lost. I've sent over 15 emails to my teacher over the last month about it and its getting to the point where she isnt even reading them and answering them correctly. The rest of the kids are just as lost and just fucking pissed off. My group is literally so fucking lazy I've done this whole god damn project up until now and given up day's back to back of sleep. I've let the teacher know and she just blows me off. 

This is fucking crazy. It's ironic how everything this class teaches on paper: ""Effective communication, sending clear messages, being open to communications and empathetic etc"" literally don't apply when it comes to the fucking staff. Fuck You Professor M. Bullshit ass class.

This is my third year in school, and I switched majors Spring 2019. It seems like I wont graduate until at least Spring 2024 or even Fall 2024. Meaning I would be in school for 6 years at that point. What's worrying me is that I don't even know if I could graduate in 2024. I'm more than likely gonna graduate even later. I'm a Mechanical Engineering major and at my uni we have advisors that are related to our major. (e.g. ME professors are advisors for ME students, etc.) My advisor straight up told me that I won't be able to handle future courses in this major if I can't handle Calc 2. 

Maybe he's right, but in my defense my prof actually sucks. I try to not blame the professor for my failures since there are other people in the class that have A's, but the hw is much harder than the lecture, and the exams are even harder than the hw.

It feels like this class is like that one meme where its like ""lecture: 2+2+4, exam: calculate the mass of the sun"". Don't know if any ME majors can tell me if my advisor was being fr or if he was being a dick. This is my first time taking Cal 2, and I did relatively well in me previous math courses. I got a B in College Algebra and Cal 1, with a C in pre-cal. 

I would like to say that being completely online has made it harder for me, but like I said, I don't want to blame outside factors for my failures. Especially since there are people in my class that have an A, so it is definitely possible. 

Honestly, if I have to retake cal 2 I wouldn't be surprised. It sucks, and I feel embarrassed for myself since I let it get this bad, but I really am trying.",2,1,avnscyrrej

Well, I'm in my first semester and I hate it. I'm on the verge of failing chemistry (currently have a 63) due both to my depleting mental health and a learning disability. Online learning has been horrible for me, and two of my teachers aren't even really teaching anymore.

I just can't imagine doing MLT my whole life, but my mom was so excited when I told her I wanted to this since it pretty much guarantees a much better chance at getting a job since medical jobs are usually in demand. I don't want to disappoint her, but I also want to do what I want with my own life.

I'm not sure if I want to switch majors, take a leave of absence to get some actual therapy or what. I'm not even sure if I can handle college at all. I haven't been able to make any friends due to terrible social anxiety and studying is a nightmare on my nerves. I'm also really scared of failing since my family is in a really bad financial situation and if I fail a class I don't know if I'll be able to get financial aid in the future.

In general, I just feel trapped. I know this is sort of a vent, but nobody is even trying to help me except my mom and I already feel like I've let her down.

566,jez452,2020-10-20 21:30:12,CollegeRant,Professors who do the bare minimum,"Why tell me to read the book if you're going to read verbatim off of a slideshow that as all of the same information? And it's a slideshow that you didn't make, it's from the publisher. Oh, and you put the slideshow online anyway. You told us that we have to come to the lectures, you're downloading attendance and you're not recording them so we can't review them later. What's the point in coming to class at 8 AM if you're going to read the PowerPoint to us like we're kids being read a story? I understand the value of a slideshow, I really do, but when you add absolutely nothing else to it during your 'lecture', it becomes mind-numbing and borderline insulting. Do you really think that I can't read it by myself?And then we're told that if we have questions we have to email you later. *So what is the point of live lectures then?* 

I don't know what's worse, these kinds of professors, or the ones who can't even be bothered to read off a slideshow and only post YouTube links (usually to Khan Academy). Those are great *study* resources, but I'm not paying thousands of dollars to be told to watch YouTube. I have friends who send me YouTube links all of the time, and for free.

569,jdxl17,2020-10-19 07:56:36,CollegeRant,"To my classmate who begged for access to a Google Doc where me and several other classmates completed the study guide for our midterm over Zoom,","I couldn't get to your message (or any of the dozen or so others you sent) until this morning, Senior Classmate Who Is Begging For Access To The Complete Study Guide, because I spent this weekend travelling home. There are a few reasons you will not be getting access to the study guide:

1. When you can't make the designated time for study group, you need to communicate that to me and future study group hosts BEFOREHAND. This shouldn't have had to be said, one COM major to another. Me and those who attended were offended and disappointed that those of you who didn't show up gave no notice whatsoever and all of us agreed that you and the others who failed to attend and communicate needed to be cut off. Classmate Number 3 set a good example here. He let me know over email that he would be late and really wanted to contribute to the document, and then he followed through on that promise to show up and contribute. You and several others did not so much as let me, the host, know that you would not make our Zoom call nor would you be adding stuff to the document later.

2. Your access and that off those who failed to communicate or show up was cut off because you did not communicate that you weren't going to make it and me and those who did contribute to the document over our 3+ hours Zoom call agreed it is not fair in the slightest for you to freeload off of our hard work. This feeds right back to my first point about communication. All you had to do was communicate with me, and contribute to the document later once I knew to not cut you off right after the Zoom call ended, and we wouldn't be here.

3. The deadline to take the exam has already passed.

4. Your grade and procrastination on taking this exam as well as getting and understanding the material for this course is not my problem. You had a week to study for the exam (with nothing assigned in this class, might I add!), and 4 days/96 hours to actually take the test. Just like me, you are an adult and you need to deal with it yourself in all necessary ways. And personally, I refuse to carry butt anyway. Go find someone else to do that.

5.  Frankly I'm surprised you are still in this class after having the brazen, iron-clad balls to blatantly plagiarize the Wikipedia page for the film we had to watch in early October. If I was able to read your comment and think that that wasn't written in your own words, and then pull up the first result in a Google Search and see it read exactly what you wrote word for word for a summary of the film, Professor can do that too. You seriously need to hope you haven't already been referred to an Academic Disciplinary council or whatever they call those at this university because you can seriously get expelled and kicked out permanently for this. You can bet I reported it immediately to Professor because in any academic setting there is nothing more offensive you can do to your classmates than plagiarize. I say this as someone who has published research in our university's academic journal.

Some advice for next time, if you even have a next time at this point: communicate with your study group's host BEFOREHAND, make plans and follow through to not procrastinate, and do not attempt to guilt the host into sharing their hard work with you when you did not take any initiative other than to say yes to my offer to organize a Zoom call, which was sent to the class a week before the exam opened online.

TL;DR: Senior classmate with the same major as me who also happens to be a plagiarizer failed to do the one thing we study how to do, spammed my email asking for the study guide we completed without them only within the 24 hours prior to the exam being due while ending each email with ""I really need to pass this class!"" Thanks for listening to my rant about how irritating this particular classmate is. It's a weight off my chest. Let others know when you ain't gonna make a Zoom call folks.",0,1,Bri70_vengeance

This put me through a mental wringer for a couple of months. Don’t have health insurance so I never went to a doctor for being ill because I couldn’t afford it. So after feeling burnt out after dealing with the appeals my teacher made that comment about my lab and it crushed me.

Having taken a bunch of professors, I noticed that many of these classes involve the same thing:

\-having a required textbook where required reading comes from (and it's expensive)

\-doing discussion posts and making students reply to them in a certain amount of words

\-requiring students to attend lectures, read the book, and watch online lectures, despite all covering the exact same material

\-doing online quizzes but the time limit to take it is so short, students practically have to have memorized facts to just scrape by it

And so many more I probably can't think of (because it's nearly 4 AM right now but I feel compelled to get these thoughts out). It just feels so old, like I should've gotten past this kind of learning. This is amplified by the fact that I've taken professors who don't do any of this stuff and just taught what they loved. Even better, some of them would have open note quizzes, because they know students are not machines whose sole purpose is to memorize facts. And it's so weird because **I seem to learn more from professors who don't require a textbook than from professors who do.** 

Now, I can sympathize with professors because I know they have lives outside of teaching, and a lot of their work with the university is research-based. At the same time, however, I wish they would take time in their day to put together a good curriculum that doesn't require them to say ""turn to page 575."" 

I'm hoping more professors ditch these kinds of outdated methods for teaching and actually engage in the students. Maybe then, they can get excited and not see the class as an obstacle.",13,1,StrictlyLoony

No online videos, lectures or such just Textbook, MyMathLab, and quizzes. I honestly don't even know the name of half my professors because I don't have to. All I need to know is when the assignments on Connect are due and when the exams are. I just realized today that one of my professors doesn't even have to grade a single thing. Not one thing the entire semester. No lecture either. And if you arent even teaching a lecture, what is the point of having a professor in a class? Might as well just cut the middle man out and have the class done entirely through Connect.

Sure maybe these automated services reduce tedious grading but it is insane to use that in place of real teaching. You get mad about students cheating, yet hand them a textbook and expect them to master advanced subjects like Chemistry or Physics?

I am in my last year of my BBA. In my program we get placed into set groups. These groups follow us from class to class. During the first group assignment we have one of my group members, lets call them A,  begins accessing a solution manual and copies and pastes the answers into our shared document. My members, lets call them B and C, and I tell our program head. 

We do this because we know A cannot get into any serious trouble as we never submitted a deliverable. However, we do not want to police their work either. But, our Program Head refuses to do anything and says if there is plagiarism within our assignments he will exempt B, C, and myself from any trouble.

So we have A who is a cheater and puts the whole group at risk. 

Group member B is an international student who is in a completely different time zone. at 1:00pm here it is 5:00am in their time zone. This has made working with them very hard as there are very few common times to meet in. They also produce low quality work and skim assignment instructions. They don't cheat, but they put in a minimum effort.

So we have B who is hard to get a hold of and needs all of their work looked over.

Group member C doesn't talk. No joke. If we are on a group call and ask them if they are ok with our group decision or want their input, we get radio silence. They produce decent work. However, they don't reply to messages and during our group meetings they almost refuse to talk.  


This dynamic is wearing on me. I pride myself in being a good group member. But, I don't have one solid person I can even depend on. I feel alone. I am so irritable. I am used to achieving very high grades. These feelings of stress and irritation are spilling into my other facets of my life.

579,j7il1i,2020-10-08 18:30:37,CollegeRant,I (without thinking) asked a question in a group chat about an online exam while it was still open and got reported to the prof,"My big lecture class has a groupme and until today, everyone was following rules and no one was sharing answers for the class or anything. We had an exam this morning, and I’ve been preparing for it for days and studying really hard for the class.

During the exam there was a question that I thought did not have the correct answer based on what I remember from the book and what I studied earlier. After I completed my exam I checked the textbook and my suspicion was correct. I wasn’t thinking about the fact that the test was still open for other people and I asked about the question in the groupme and said that I was confused because I thought that the correct answer wasn’t an answer choice. The groupme had been active earlier while I had taking my exam but obviously I was not looking at my phone during the test. A few people agreed that they were confused about it but then someone reminded everyone that the test was still active and i immediately apologized in the chat. I honestly hadnt even thought about the people still taking the exam because i also assumed that anyone still taking the exam wouldn’t be on their phone. Obviously a ton of people left the chat ASAP after that, but I stayed in because I was worried that leaving was an admission of guilt.

My prof emailed me about an hour later saying that he could not prove if the people involved (me and the people who responded) were still taking the test while I had asked the question, but he was going to make this a warning and if it ever happened again he would take action with the university. I called him immediately after I saw the email (he has told us several times he has thing about calls vs emails) and apologized profusely and offered to send the time stamps to prove that this did happen after I took my exam. He said he didn’t care and didn’t want to see it. He (rightfully) wasn’t very forgiving and kept the call very short. 

So the thing is, I am not in trouble with the university but I feel like absolute shit. As a freshman, I honestly wasn’t thinking about class groupme etiquette bc they weren’t a thing in my high school (and online exams weren’t either) but I honestly can’t believe that I was so dumb to do that. I had studied so hard for this exam to make a 96 but now I feel like it doesn’t matter. I’ve been struggling in school and so I was really proud but now I don’t really want to even go to class next week. Im not a good person per say, but I don’t get in trouble a lot so maybe I’m taking this harder than I should but I don’t know what to do. This was my favorite class and it was my only in person class but I’m thinking of going online for a while just so I don’t have to show my face. I would really love any insight on the situation, I know I’m in the wrong but like is my mistake still understandable? I just feel like since my professor was so dismissive that I deserve to feel as bad as I do for what I did. 

Also I’m sorry this is so long I just wanted to be thorough.  

TL:DR I thought the exam didn’t have the correct answer choice and so when I completed my exam I without thinking asked in my class gc about it while the test was still live for people taking it. I was reported to the prof and while I’m not in trouble with the university, I feel awful for what happened.",4,1,gnf8290
580,j7bvk7,2020-10-08 12:09:24,CollegeRant,Online studies gives you way more control than you think,"Being a student myself, I see that for most of us online studies is not one of the most effective ways to learn things because of many things such as, **many distractions, professors are giving to many assignments, the lectures are boring, the overall confusion about what assignments to do and in what order.** 

For unprepared students, this online studies environment can lead to laziness, stress, lack of motivation, lack of clarity and burnout.

The thing I realized is that during the physical classes, it was easier for us to go through the day, because each class had a specific classroom and it was easy for our minds to associate certain places with certain activities, just like we associate bed with sleeping. This way the brain separates the information in chunks, like ""I attended 3 classes, 1 for math, 2nd for physics and the 3rd for History"", that way it felt ok with the information we received. 

During the online studies, you are just in one single room and your mind can not associate different places with different activities, now you're doing AND math, AND physics AND history in one single place, and this time it feels like a BIG chunk of information received. That's why you're feeling more overwhelmed with this, your brain perceives the information as ""Too much"" and it degreases your productivity level.

Not understanding how to create an effective studying environment will cause you trouble and suffering big time. 

The big plus with online studies is that you don't waste time to get to university or other places, you're taking more control of your time. You can literally design your lifestyle with that, see this as an opportunity to develop a stronger discipline and willpower.

581,j6z53l,2020-10-07 20:50:30,CollegeRant,Venting about a class,"Hey All,

Currently in community college looking to transfer for next fall. These online courses have made it more difficult for me and given me stress (I’m a better learner when I’m physically in a classroom). I am stressing to the point of giving up this one class. I have already applied and sent my application to various universities to transfer but I feel like I am going to fail one of my classes and I don’t know what to do. This course is a 3 unit class that I need to pass to transfer. No lectures or anything, just 3 assignments determine your grade. One quiz, one paper, and one final. 

With no lectures or material besides one article given to us I got a 53% on the quiz. Looking back now I kind of gave up then bc the class was determined by 3 assignments and I already failed one. Next up was the paper... it was on a sociology book that we had to write about and he gave us a prompt and I could tell he would be a hard grader. We had no class discussion boards beforehand about the book with others in the class or any group work analysis of certain chapters or parts. Just here’s a book now write a paper. I ended up writing the paper to the best I could, I was stressed and just wanted to not even turn it in... but I pushed through and completed it to what I thought was a decent paper.

I hear back from the professor and he gave me a 50%... he noted that I didn’t not analyze the themes correctly and my format was incorrect and basically docked 20% of the paper because of format.... I couldn’t believe it. I cried so much bc even if I miraculously get a 100% on the final, I’m still going to fail. I don’t know what to do at this point. I fail this class and the applications I sent for transfers will mean nothing. 

Apart of me feels like this isn’t fair... a 3 unit course and 3 assignments determine your final grade. But I can’t complain. Thank you for letting me vent.",4,1,LittleRey97

583,j6fvar,2020-10-06 23:16:10,CollegeRant,Possible refund,"So I've been regretting about joining a Auto Tech program that's 30 mins away from home. If you're wondering why, for one, I was told that classes were going to be in person only but turns out classes are online 2 days out of 4. Another reason why i'm regretting this decision is because I've been thinking and I don't think this is the career I want to choose. Also, I was a kid that was told college is the way to go, but I don't believe in this statement if I don't even wanna know what I wanna do with my life. I was thinking since class is online, I feel like I won't even get the proper education I was expecting. I realize how hard professors are trying to make it work, but it isn't for me. My moms boyfriend works at a shop from time to time and I think it would be better to learn there instead of staring at a screen two days out of the week. I've been registered for under a week (five days), and if i'm being honest, I haven't went to class at all. Unfortunately, the college said there's no way to get my full refund since I registered after the full refund deadline (which I had no idea). The only way I could even get the slightest chance of getting my full refund is contacting the professor. So I called him twice, left him a voice mail, and emailed him. But he hasn't contacted me at all. It has been over 24 hours. Yes I realize that this isn't that much time, but I am eager to know if he can help me get the refund. If he doesn't bother to help me or contact me, I might just get the 50% refund and pay back what I owe to my parents. I know I should've made a decision earlier, and that all of this is my fault, but I guess I just went because I was pressured and didn't want to disappoint my parents. I'm not saying I'm not gonna do anything with my life, but I don't see the point in going if it doesn't interest me. I literally can't stop thinking of this.

584,j5m9yi,2020-10-05 16:12:03,CollegeRant,"So now the entire class has to re-take the exam because damn near everyone bombed. Teacher's response? ""It's both of our fault but also entirely your fault"".","&gt;I have finished grading the exams, and unfortunately the scores were extremely low. I will post exam scores on Monday afternoon, but before I post those I wanted to be sure that you see this - please read this (long) announcement completely.  
&gt;  
&gt;I believe the low scores are due to a combination of things - some of which you as students need to take responsibility for and others which I need to take responsibility for.  

Immediately going ""it's not *entirely* my fault!"" and telling others to ""take responsibility"" unprompted *really* makes you look like the responsible adult, especially when it's your opening...

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;As far as your responsibility, here are a few thoughts (and remember that these are in general - some will apply to you, some may not):  
&gt;  
&gt;1. I have concerns that due to the exam being open note/book, you did not spend adequate time studying or preparing for the exam. My expectations were that you would study like a normal exam, but also have your notes available to you so you did not have to memorize every single item. Your notes should have been organized, you may have made additional notes that summarized items to make it easier to find what you needed, and you should have come into the exam with a solid grasp of the material and where to find answers. Based on your answers, I do not believe this was the case. Even items that were directly from the notes or book were frequently answered incorrectly. You should have known your notes so well, you could have found those answers and confidently gotten those questions correct. Instead, I think a lot of you felt extremely pressed for time and weren't able to take advantage of the test being open note because you didn't know where things were in your notes. 

Doesn't mean shit when you don't give us access to our assignments after they were turned in so we know what we got right and what we got wrong so we can make notes. You know, the very fucking thing I brought to your attention and you responded with ""iT pReVeNtS cHeAtInG!!!""? As for not having enough time because we ""didn't study our notes enough to know them inside and out"", that's kind of what happens when you have a one-hour time limit on a 40-question exam with mandatory long-form answers in response to paragraph-long scenarios on 20 of those questions. Oh, and we're going in blind with no idea what exactly is going to be on there since you have this nasty habit of only covering one or two things out of the dozens of concepts in each chapter so note-taking is like finding a needle in a haystack while blindfolded.  


&gt;2. I have concerns that you have not been reading the book thoroughly and/or watching the lectures with a high level of detail and participation. Because this class is asynchronous, you must take an additional level of ownership over the material. You must read the book and watch the lectures in order to grasp the material. If you read the book/watch the lectures once and it doesn't make sense - do it again! You will understand additional information each time. Based on your answers, it does not seem that you have grasped the overall concepts we have covered in the lectures. 

""You must start doing the thing that I'm going to assume you're not doing so I justify my attempt at pointing fingers!"" Maybe we would grasp the material if your immediate response to people trying to better understand what they don't understand wasn't ""read the book/instructions"" and then telling them that you won't make changes to how you do things without proof the person has a disability.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;As far as things I could have done differently:  
&gt;  
&gt;1. I do not think as a whole that this class has grasped exactly what an audit is and how the pieces we're talking about each chapter connect to the audit and it's goals. While I believe that if you read the book, it would help on this front, I also could have done things differently. A lot of this would come from in class discussion and in teaching this class online, I think that discussion is lost and I did not adequately replace it in my lectures.

Pointing at others in your bulletpoint that was supposed to be dedicated to pointing at yourself is not the mark of a responsible adult, ""Doctor"". Maybe if you actually *helped* students asking for help understanding something rather than demanding they see a disability representative first. It's almost like the most important part of a discussion is having a discussion when a student comes to you for a fucking discussion.  


&gt;2. I think that you went into the exam without knowing what questions I may be asking, what the format of those questions would be, how to answer questions completely, and how you could focus your studying. I could have improved this with additional feedback on homework/quizzes, a study guide, or a review lecture. 

That's how exams should be - you shouldn't know what the questions are, just the general content that will be covered. And yes, you could be. You also could be giving us access to the answers to our homework assignments and which questions were wrong on said assignments and exam so we have context to your feedback so we can actually make corrections and learn from our mistakes.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;3. I think a lot of you were pressed for time on the exam which severely hurt your grade. While I think that additional studying/preparation on your part could have helped this, I also could have given additional time on the exam to reduce the time pressure.

Again, that's kind of what happens when you have a one-hour time limit on a 40-question exam with mandatory long-form answers in response to paragraph-long scenarios on 20 of those questions.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;So you might be asking - where do we go from here and what's the deal with Exam 1 grades?  
&gt;  
&gt;Here is what I have decided:  
&gt;  
&gt;1. Our schedule is changing. Week 8 instead of continuing on to Chapter 7, we are going to take a pause and do a Recap of Weeks 1 - 6. I will be posting videos intended to summarize the information for you, prepare you for the exam, and fill in the gaps that I identified through Exam 1. These items will be available starting 10/10.  
&gt;  
&gt;2. I will be posting an updated schedule and adjusting due dates on Connect. Everything Week 8 on will be changing. This change does mean that there is work on Thanksgiving week whereas there had not been prior. There will be one chapter and one homework due. Per the schedule, there is class M that week, so I think this is extremely fair. Part of the reason I left this week blank to begin with was so I could adjust the schedule if needed. I'm grateful that I have this week so that I don't have to double up weeks in order to make room for the Recap week I believe is needed. There will only be one item due as to not overwhelm or hinder your Thanksgiving plans. 

If you already allotted a week into the schedule so you have room to move just in case something like this happens, maybe you should have focused more on *how you're interacting with the students* rather than going in confident your way is the best way and that any student who disagrees is (1) lazy or (2) mentally disabled. I'd pat you on the back but I'm afraid I'd punch you in the stomach given how you've bent over backwards to kiss your own ass.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;3. At the end of Week 8, you will have the opportunity to retake the exam. The exam will be open 10/15 12:01 - 10/16 at 11:59pm The retake will be similar but not identical to Exam 1. You will have a greater amount of time to complete the exam. You might be wondering, what if I want to accept my Exam 1 grade? I ask that you trust me when I say you don't want to accept your Exam 1 grade. I believe everyone will do better on the retake, and I am asking and expecting everyone to retake the exam. That being said, if after retaking the exam your original score was higher, you may keep your original score. 

Because we totally have time to study for an exam we were not properly prepared for with no materials beyond what we already used. We will absolutely do better in an exam just by diving in blind a second time.  


&gt;I am going to post a discussion board in Week 7 content with this same information. I ask that you comment on it saying ""Got it!"" or something similar so that I can be sure everyone is aware of this change.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Audit is hard - it's a totally different type of accounting class. It requires understanding the financial statements AND understanding how to audit them. It's totally new to you - it's hard! 

Especially when the teacher refuse to take student feedback that says you don't provide us with the necessary tools to learn the topic coupled with complaints that your time limits on assignments are ridiculously unrealistic. Even more so when said teacher can't help but blame their students even in the parts where they claim they're going to take responsibility for their own actions. 

&gt;I believe in you and think that you can seriously improve your scores if we work together. I'm going to do what I can to help you guys, and I ask that you put in the effort too - let's do it together!  
&gt;  
&gt;As always, email me with any questions or concerns!

585,j5l6sa,2020-10-05 15:14:23,CollegeRant,The worst class I've ever been in.,"The idea of graded participation through the online format makes sense to me, I know profs and tas want their students to be just as involved outside of the classroom, but I feel like theyre going about it in a terrible way. I'm in a required 300 level Business school course right now, and I have seriously never been more frustrated with a class. It goes to show you how pathetic my schos business school actually is, and they rejected my first application! The school is a joke. 

We are taught by the textbook, which is accompanied by a couple 8 min videos from the professor who basically just shows video clips the entire time. This isn't really bothersome, because the content is INCREDIBLY easy, however I still think it important to discuss what we learned in discussion. 

Now, discussion meets every Friday morning, which sucks, but whatever. We spend the first five minutes doing these icebreakers. Last class she asked us riddles like, ""how much dirt is in a 3 by 5 by 2 ft hole??"", which is probably an appropriate question for us B school students. We then spend the rest of the time discussing the assignments due earlier in the week. This is a graded discussion, so everyone in my 30 person class is constantly raising their hand, typing in chat, and it's impossible to get a word in. The regular hand raisers have established themselves to be the main talkers who she always calls on , so it's pointless to even try to speak. The students in the class have nothing to say and can't build  off each other's thoughts so they go around saying ""I agree with X because..."" And I feel like I'm back in high school.  I resort to typing in the chat to respond but she never looks at it. Discussion grades are either 0, .5 and 1. I usually get a .5, which is equivalent to showing up to class, being an active listener, and aiding in discussion. She will only give you a 1 if you are an integral part of discussion and if you weren't there, the class discussion wouldn't have been as great. Since everyone needs to talk, we always end up going past 10 to 15 minutes after class, which I find incredibly ridiculous and selfish. 

Not only this, but all our assignments are group assignments. So my group of 6 people has to find a convenient time for everyone to meet for 2+ hours to do our assignments that I could do alone in 30 mins. Not only this, but the assignments are due on Wednesday, but the only time my group can meet is Sunday, which means I have to the read chapter and watch the lecture videos a week in advance to discussion and still be prepared to talk about it Friday morning. 

My TA is also a fucking bitch. She's 30 years old and talks down to us like we are idiots. Bitch, we're in intro to marketing, it's not fucking hard, and you're also not my professor. Shes the type of grader to always give .5 off and never give full points. All of my group assignments have received 3.75/4 with the only comment being ""amazing job!!"". If it's so amazing, give me full fucking points!!  Like I mentioned before I never get for points for discussion, that that's basically a guaranteed 7 points missing from my final grade. 

I think that class is stupid as shit and should be easier if it's a required course. I don't want to be a marketing major, I don't want to be a leader in class and share my every thought. Im a god damn act sci major, I love math.",0,1,jakeypoom

I'm a freshman in college at the moment in my first semester, and I have a mix of in person and online classes. I just learn better in person, especially with lecture heavy classes. I have no motivation to sit down and read through long textbook chapters, I don't know what's wrong with me, but I just can't. I feel like a fraud.

I'm also an art major, so my art classes are in person, and we also have zoom meetings. The only entirely online class I have, where I don't have any interactions with my professor, is my art history class. It is also my most lecture heavy class. I have to memorize dates, artists, trends in different periods of time, etc.

My problem is I just fucking can't. I hate reading text books, I hate listening to video lectures. When I'm at an in person lecture, I feel compelled to take notes and pay attention, and that helps me tremendously with memorization. That doesn't happen in this class.

Onto my actual problem, I feel like a fraud. Except for my classes where we actually make art, I put in no effort. Public speaking class? I make my presentation the day before. Art history? I google the answers on our exams. I used to feel awful about cheaters, but now I am one, and I don't care. I justify this to myself with this: when will I not be able to google all the info I need on a certain painting? Our exams are literally just a random assortment of paintings and we have to write down the artist, when they made it, why they made it, etc. All of those answers are literally on the first paragraph of wikipedia.

In high school, I was the ""smart"" kid. I got all A's with no effort, I fucking graduated with a 4.0. GPA. I figured if high school was that easy, college will be a breeze, right? Nope, I'm drowning in busy work.

Overall, I can see where this mindset will take me, I'll just end up googling all the answers in my classes where I'm not required to produce artwork, and I fear where that path will lead me to. When I enter the workforce, will I actually a be a fraud, will I be unworthy of my own degree?

He also would sit with his arms up on the desk, and everyone could see what he was doing on his phone. My professor would go around the room asking people's opinions on things. When she got to him, he'd be like huh? 

Now that I'm online, I apparently have two classes with this guy. He hit me up about one of our class' textbook, which he claimed he was waiting for it to ship in. I honestly don't think that's true. I did have the pdf for it, and I don't mind sending the pdf, but it got worse. He hit me up again like ""do you have the pdf for x textbook for our class?"" I rented it off Chegg for like 60 bucks. I told him that, and responded ""do you have it right now?"" 

Bitch. I did not rent a textbook for 60 fucking dollars just so I can send it to you. And it's not a short chapter, it's like 30 pages per chapter. We are 4 weeks into class, and this hoe literally doesn't have any books, so I'm sure he's just trying to get it off someone else. I hate this laziness.

592,j2jr9t,2020-09-30 10:39:29,CollegeRant,Online Learning and mental illness is going to be the death of me,"So I just transferred from an average university to a really good one. 

I have been doing terribly and I’m hiding it from everyone. I have a history of mental illness and trauma, I took a year off from university because of it. 

I’m falling behind. My math class is unsalvageable. I’m three chapters behind. We have a quiz tonight and a midterm next week. I’m dropping it. I am almost positive I have a math learning disability  and I’m going to be tested soon. I have a tutor but nothing helps because my concentration is so shot. 

My writing class is madness. I’ve taken writing classes before but they didn’t transfer. Every single day is torture. I have a thousand templates to fill out and a 9 module student integrity course to complete. He says if we don’t do it his way there is no chance of getting an A. So far I’m behind on a source template that I can’t sit still enough to finish. Due to my trauma and meds I have mild memory loss issues. I have no access to the template that was partly completed by me and submitted and I need it and I’m too anxious to ask prof about it. 

I’m also behind on my science class. I need to watch videos of a chapter that she filmed over the weekend. No motivation to do so. We have a quiz tomorrow. I’m so screwed.

I’ve reached out to the counselors and academic support Center. I’m going to try again but I just really wanted to get this out to anyone who could relate so I dont feel like such a defective failure. Thanks if you’ve read all of this.",11,1,snarks_
593,j1th4d,2020-09-29 05:54:13,CollegeRant,No seriously. Pat yourselves on the back.,"I don’t know how some of you guys do it. I’m a full time student at the moment using the GI bill. This is my 4th semester back to school and I was going to try to work while in school to be more productive and save up more money on top of what I’m saving from my GI Bill. 

Right before the semester started, I took a break from school and told my employer that I would come back depending on how I felt which was already agreed between us. They were pretty cool about it and understood. A couple weeks in and I was already drowning in work and had to tell my employer that I wouldn’t be able to return because of all the work I’ve been doing.It’s even been hard enough to balance my daily gym time and time with my girlfriend which are two very important things to me. 

I don’t know how some of you guys work so many hours, take care of loved ones, and still stay afloat in school. I’ve always respected that and respect it even more now that online classes, the work load that comes with it, possibly having kids that are also doing remote learning, and an even more stressful time at work during everything that’s going on.

I’m still about fucking tired of trying to learn math for the first time in 10 years through an online class. Let’s be honest.

I’ve never had a semester go by this slowly, and all my classes are high level and extremely tedious and draining. I’m a senior and thought that I’d have the hang of this whole college thing by now but I feel like I’m stuck in an endless purgatory that is online music school. I can’t perform, which is my major, online  music lessons are constantly glitching, and all my classes are less than 6 people so I get cold called on at least 5 times per class which I loathe. I’m doing schoolwork from 9am to 10pm every night and honestly I’m considering dropping out and doing a cosmetology degree just to have something interactive and actually interesting to do. I feel like this isn’t smart, but then again the music industry isn’t exactly thriving so I feel like I’d have a better chance of getting a job in a more essential field.

595,iyp4kf,2020-09-24 03:06:36,CollegeRant,So done with one of my online classes and just online classes in general,"So, I'm a dual enrolled sophomore in college (junior in HS) and I've just kinda hit a point of being done. Like, I've gotten sooo lucky with my professors, they're doing the best with what they've got but it's still so frustrating, especially for someone who learns really well in a classroom environment and not from videos. The one professor who is really bugging me right now is my Honors Explorations professor. 

My college makes us go through basically a study skills/college success skills class before letting you take any Honors courses. So, I received my invitation and decided that I would get the class over with this semester, that way next semester I can take my first official Honors Course. Well this class is basically a waste of time. He 'taught' us how to find peer reviewed sources on the databases, we have to do butt tons of discussion posts which causes forced and graded discussion which is more stressful than interesting or helpful, and we have to write like five papers over the semester. Now, five 1,000 word or more papers aren't that bad. For the final paper and the next paper we write, we have to make an office appointment with him and go prove that we read the book for the paper or go give a presentation. This also may require that we go to his office at a campus that is over an hour away from where I live to go prove to him that I read a book. He also has the descriptions and the due dates for these upcoming papers all weird so that they are literally due 1 day apart... Yeah. So, at this point I just want to say screw it and drop it, but if I make it out of this class and complete three more honors courses I'll be able to graduate with honors, which will help me in the future.

I don't know, I'm just going to deal with it, but it feels nice to rant to people who might kinda understand where I'm coming from.

TL;DR: Tired of Honors orientation course due to large amount of requirements and the professor's inability to correctly write an assignment page/put in a due date. Also, online classes suck for people who hate videos (aka me).",0,1,PsychGirl03
596,ixvqs3,2020-09-22 20:36:36,CollegeRant,College is killing my soul,"I literally cannot stand college. This is my second year at a community college and I hate it so much. The only reason I’m there is so my parents won’t kick me out of the house. It was either go to college or Goodluck in life. I’ve literally tried to meet 100’s of people but no one there wants to be there, they are there to get class over with and go home. There are no groups or organizations going on rn so I can’t meet people that way either. Even when Corona wasn’t going on I was bored out of my mind. Every weekend I’d see everyone who went away having fun while I’m watching Netflix on a Friday night. The classes are also fucking horrible. It’s a community college so they have a very limited selection, so odds are you’re gonna be in some classes you have absolutely no interest just do you have a class. Last semester I was in art appreciation cause that’s all they had for me. I was mind numbingly bored in class last semester so imagine how I feel now that classes are all online and I can’t even try to meet new people. I just log onto zoom everyday and try to pay attention to shit I have 0 interest in. Then there are breakout rooms where no one talks for 15 minutes and we just stare, searching endlessly through blackboard just to locate something, and not being able to use google because our school is using proctorio so I have to actually try.

597,ixij31,2020-09-22 07:00:46,CollegeRant,Withdrawing From The Same Course... A Second Time. It's Still Required Though.,"Hey everyone. I'm currently a sophomore at my university seeking to major in Marketing with a minor in comp sci and/or environmental science. The issue? Just like the majority of us-- online classes suck. My current dilemma right now is my concern with dropping Intro to Accounting for the second time (it's required for my business school pre-reqs, but it has one of the highest attrition/failure rates at my school). This may or may not sound silly, but I keep frustratingly giving up on this class. Which is unlike me. I've always been a headstrong student that strives for good grades. I KNOW I could do much better if it were an in-person course. During the summer I took 3 online courses including intro to accounting, but the other two courses were one credit and self paced. While taking accounting over the summer, not only was the course accelerated (a semester worth of content within 5-6 weeks) but a lot of distractions were occurring outside of the pandemic. Racial injustices and my step dad's mental health was deteriorating. His actions were affecting my focus because I was concerned for my mother and their frequent hospital runs amidst the pandemic.  I was able to withdraw from it...until I decided I would try and knock it out this fall. I registered for the class late because I forgot to add it back to my schedule (I should've kept it that way tbh). It's a class that only meets on Mondays for 2 hours and I should add that I missed the first class because I registered late so I was already behind. I fell even more behind which I feel like I can't blame anyone except for myself. 

My health has been a concern because I've been experiencing localized chest pains and dyspnea for a month along with anxiety. I tested negative for COVID-19 a few days ago, which helped bring down my anxiety and the symptoms that manifested physically because of it. I've also been dealing with some family issues which caused me to relocate back to my mom's place out of state. I say all of this to add: on top of struggling to stay focused on the content for this class, I've been going through a lot at home despite the pandemic. I always try to use my obstacles for motivation, but I didn't want to proceed with the class if I knew that at the end it was very likely I might not pass. I withdrew from the course, halfway regretting it... but I keep thinking about how I'd rather have a third W on my transcript (first one was from freshman year first semester) than a D or F. The reason I care so much? Grad school. 

TD;LR I withdrew from a pre-req class (accounting) for business school (undergrad) a second time... I'm afraid of how it'll affect my chances of getting into a good grad school. I know it seems like I have better things to worry about but I hate beating myself up for this decision because I'm still gonna have to try and take the class anyway... and it may end up having to be online again *anyway* because of COVID.",0,1,thriftyriah

Hi, freshman here. I’m currently a ChemE major. I’ve taken college courses in high school, so I’m in some second year classes, including organic chemistry. The lecture portion of class is okay, its a little confusing, but I’m doing alright. The issue I have is with lab. I have lab in person every other week, and the weeks I’m not in person, I have an online lab. I just had an in person lab this past week, and it went awful. I was anxious the whole time, I had so many questions, and I did one part of the experiment completely wrong. It was highly stressful, and I wanted to just crawl home and cry.

Labs haven’t been my strong suit, but I didn’t think things would get this bad. This past week’s lab was only my second in-person lab. Now I’m questioning my entire major, because I don’t want to keep doing labs for the rest of my life. I’m just concerned because even if I do decide to change my major, I don’t know what I’d do. That, and if I change my major, I’d probably have to transfer schools, as I chose this school for ChemE. I just don’t know what to do.

It’s like he can’t stand teaching so he rushes through. If you have a question about the section he just covered, he tells you to go on khan academy.

Fast forward a month and I am beyond annoyed with my friend. I have known him since 8th grade and we have a lot in common so I thought it would work fine. But here’s the situation...
-
The first thing that bothers the shit out of me with him is that he is an impulsive liar. He will lie just to get out of a situation, even though I know he is full of shit there’s not much I can do. For example, he ate Ramen on three separate occasions and didn’t clean the bowls...then he said he didn’t use the bowls and I had to do his dishes. He also said the cost of a fouton was $300, when I looked up the model it was $200. He was trying to steal money from me, ridiculous!

Secondly, he has a narcissistic personality. He has openly told me he does. He always tries to belittle me when I do basic things. He tells me that I take too long on homework and quizzes and tries to make me feel like a dumbass. He literally takes the most shortcuts possible with little effort so he can play video games.
He always talks himself up just to get praise, we are in college and he still brags about his high school GPA...nobody cares buddy.

Thirdly, he is so goddamn lazy. I ask if he wants to do stuff and he will just say no and play Overwatch. He won’t even go out and use his dining plan because he doesn’t feel like it. He takes no initiative at all, he won’t take out the trash or clean up the dorm at all...if I get mad at him for it he just tells me to do it. I tell him to get out and join stuff but he says “he doesn’t want to”. I joined a political group and am a community representative and it’s annoying to see someone so content with doing nothing.

Fourthly (Stop, I’m ranting), He is a “well-actually” type person which is one of the most annoying things in the world. He tries to tell me what I am saying is wrong, when it’s something I personally experienced or read clearly online from a reliable source. He tries to be all knowing when in reality it’s okay to not know stuff. For example, he tried to lecture me on stocks because I just started trading, he opens his portfolio and he has one Disney stock...he has no clue what he’s doing.

Lastly, he never appreciates my gestures. I am super courteous to people and put others first. But, I feel like I am being taken for a ride. He is almost 19 and doesn’t have his license so I bring him to and from college, his class ends later than mine so I usually wait for him. He never says “thank you” or pays for gas...it’s like he expects me to do it because I have to.
-
I know I should give him more chances since I’ve known him for awhile but my blood is boiling. Every day it’s a combination of everything and I cannot love like this for another 7 months. Without sports being regularly played I can see we really have nothing in common at all, and it’s really sad to see. WHAT SHOULD I DO?!?

Now its even harder because I don't have any type of schedule with my online classes, especially since I don't have assigned times to be ""in class"" and all my work is just test, quizzes, discussions, and turning in my homework. 

I know it's best to make my own schedule because that works for me, but I always feel like I don't have time to do that because I need to be doing the work for my classes and studying.

I only have 4 classes and they aren't that hard (Soci, Psych, Geo, and Span) but trying to do the work, study, have a social life, and make free time for myself is a lot for me. My anxiety increases so much that I get overwhelmed and go into a depressive feeling afterwards and just don't do anything (which is why I'm almost falling behind in some of those classes).

Also my family isn't really helping because they always ask when am I coming back to visit them and I genuinely don't know because in the past I went home every 1-2 weeks and barely got work done. So now I'm trying to be away for longer times and work on understanding my self and how I function while also figuring out a way to finish college with at least a 3.0",0,1,smurffeet

I go to a decent university and never really had much of a problem until this semester. Maybe i just have really bad luck.

So far i have one professor who will talk well over the class time limit. Im talking 30 minutes past the end of class. Sometimes not even about class material. Will go on long rants and have an attitude if people leave the zoom call before they finished. Has also told us the class may start being held outdoors On campus instead of online because in person teaching is more comfortable for them.

I have another who unfortunately had to be quarantined the second week of class. and just announced that we need to make arraignments with our schedule because we will be going over the class time once class is back in session. This professor is giving us the two tests we missed due to him canceling class plus a lab experiment.

Anyone else got horror stories so far? Figured might be a nice place for other to vent their frustrations

Even when i have a friend over its kind of awkward having someone else there listening. I had my own room last yr and loved it. Its so much less stressful. Between work, activities and social life i leave the room quite often so she has plenty of alone time. The thing that sucks is that theres rlly no solution to this. She doesnt have many friends so thats why shes always in the room. I get its her room just as much as it is mine but i really just cant stand sharing a space at all.

It's the 2nd week of online classes (3rd semester of community college), and I just set up a countdown to when the fall semester ends. I was once looking forward to doing something mentally productive and getting back on a schedule. Until I then realized from my own mistake of registering for classes late and taking two asynchronous classes (a freshman seminar class (required by the state of TX) and U.S History) and one synchronous class (theater application). At first, I thought having two asynchronous classes will push me further to getting the assignments done early will allow more room to get everything else done. I was wrong when I looked at how many unit tests &amp; reading quizzes my U.S History professor has created; at 10 am is the first quiz, then on 9/17 is the first Unit 1 test. Feels like they are back-to-back tests from my view. Plus, with my logic of getting shit done, if I get stuff done days before the due date, then it means more time to do whatever I want at my leisure. Of course, the type of logic can go either way; productivity at an all-time high or I only have very little to no motivation at all and end up crashing &amp; burning. I honestly don't know anymore. I know I want to continue going to college to earn a degree, and not drop-out to work &amp; live paycheck to paycheck during and after a pandemic.

We use Blackboard, and in the Introduction to this specific course, the Professor lists their contact information and office location. I say all this because, when I registered for the course, it was listed as being held at one location. The Professor lists their office location as another campus, and in the Introduction of the course, the way that it is worded by the Professor, it gives the indication that this is an online course. The last one is what I thought, because you know, COVID. All that being said, I did not ""go"" to class last night. When I messaged on Monday seeking clarity, I got no response. I understand that this course is on Tuesdays, and I understand that you will reply, as per your intro ""within 48hrs"". However, is it too much to ask to be flexible and reply to something like that, something time-sensitive, outside of your normal time-frame? Especially when you're going to send me a note also via course messaging stating that I was absent, and to be aware that this is F2F, while not acknowledging that I even sent a message in the first place. In response, I respectfully asked for other mediums of communication I could be allowed to use in addition to course messaging, while also committing to being present for all subsequent classes.

625,ijy6am,2020-08-31 13:40:45,CollegeRant,I hate Blackboard... Any tips?,"Okay... So I just transferred back to a 4-year university after finishing up a year of community college (Long story). At both my community college and previous university, we used Canvas, which is an online learning platform (But you probably know that). I found it to be pretty easy to navigate. Grades were in one place, there was a clean calendar that had all due dates, assignments were easy to find, as were quizzes, and the navigation bar was standardized for all classes. I had and have no issues with Canvas whatsoever and think it's a great platform.

Now... My new university uses a system called Blackboard. I should have known from the bright purple text on the login page (that looks like a 12-year-old experimenting with HTML made it), that it was an absolute flaming ball of garbage. None of my 6 courses have the same navbar. Each has some elements missing and some random items added. It's hard to see the due dates for items simply because sometimes they're shown and sometimes they're not. The gradebook is kinda easy to access I guess, but even it can be a bit confusing.

As for the course material section, don't even get me started. Maybe it's just the way professors set them up, but some classes have nothing in course material and everything must be found on other tabs, others have course material separated by week, others have course material strewn about with no separation, and still others have some odd module that has other items built into it (Including quizzes which don't display anywhere else).

While this is a rant, I'm also looking for tips for a student new to Blackboard and taking 6 online classes. If anybody has any tips they've learned over the year(s) using it that made it easier to see upcoming assignments or easier to manage workload, please let me know. When I spoke to my department advisor about it she replied ""It's your responsibility to know when things are due, not Blackboard's."" And while that's true, I'd rather not have to reference the syllabus of every class each day keep up to date on when stuff is due when the assignments are built into the system.

There was a loophole where some classes (like engineering classes) were going to be in person, but would be uploaded online, so you would have to pay the full price of that class. When everyone complained, that is when they implemented the 10% off predetermined online classes. (I’m being charged a full price for an engineering class myself). I’m choosing to stay in school bc I wanna graduate ASAP, and I have scholarships to cover majority of costs (My tuition is 60k per year to give perspective, but I only have to pay 2k this semester but I need to work for it somehow, my parents won’t let me work or leave the house). Now, I wouldn’t have such an issue with this if it weren’t for the fact that my teachers basically uploaded the whole course online and won’t be using Zoom much. I know all the videos are there and homework to turn in, but if this was the case, it’s basically like a coursera. I’m not sure if this is fair. I know I shouldn’t be complaining bc I specifically don’t have to pay as much - but I have a lot of friends who took financial burdens to attend my university for their education and the foreign students who also are taking their classes here. My friends have to pay 10k, and for those who don’t even have scholarships and are just the “rich” kids, i feel bad for them too because they are paying so much for premade courses online. I feel their pressure because no one wants to be a semester behind. In my opinion, it just doesn’t seem fair for anyone and I feel as though the whole price of school should be reduced when no one is allowed back on campus now, which they changed SUPER late (the beginning of August!!Classes start the 24th!) Maybe the whole price should be reduced to 40k or something because students are definently not recieving the same quality of teaching.

As  I sit here in my Nutrition &amp; Physical Activity class, typing this post on one monitor with Zoom open in the other, I can't help but think back to this time last year.

I had just transferred colleges and felt like I was starting all over again.  The anxiety of starting over again led me to the darkest place I had been in in my whole life. Fast forward two months, I have two new diagnoses; ADHD and Depression. Thankfully, the meds that I take have helped tremendously and I no longer consider myself depressed.

The medications changed my outlook on life and helped me turn a new leaf.  By the end of the semester, I had made friends who I knew I could be myself around. I had gotten involved on campus and even started a band.  Things were looking up.

The new semester started and everything continued to go great. Fresh out of a  relationship, I dated a little bit with no real success, but that was ok. I continued to add and grow my friendships and enjoyed being with them. When spring break came, I did not want to go home; I was going to miss my friends too much. Having a break would be nice though, and I  would see them in a week.

Then.....

Needless to say, coming back to campus was depressing. Because of my relationship with my mom and the fact she is immunocompromised, I opted to return to campus for the remainder of the semester. Going from 1 of  3000 students on campus to 1 of 200 students was quite the shock. The campus felt.... empty and desolate. During the quarantine, I lived alone in my dorm room for about five to six weeks. While I did have a job and still had a few friends who were nearby, I was not seeing anyone anywhere near as to how much I had before. I love my alone time as much as the next guy, but not five weeks.

The semester ended, and my summer on-campus job was no longer happening,  but thankfully I was able to become a summer RA last minute. I will forever be grateful for that experience but being an RA in a dorm during a pandemic is also just depressing. We can't really congregate, so social events are next to none.

When my university announced a return to campus for the fall, I was extremely happy for things to go back to normal. How naive I was to think this would be a normal semester.

All but one of my classes are online. Zoom sucks big, hairy balls and is so unstable that all my professors cut out every five seconds. There are no fun in-person events on campus, and everyone basically stays in their rooms all the time.

Yet people have the fucking audacity to go out in public without wearing a mask and have major parties that only perpetuate this pandemic.

Fuck  you. Fuck you for being so selfish. You're the reason this pandemic is continuing to wreak havoc on the US. Your selfishness is negatively affecting everyone around you. Take a good hard look at yourself in the mirror and just think about how your actions affect others.

Fuck  the government for their shit response. Trump is a fucking dumbass. I  know fifth graders who would be more competent than him.

Fuck misinformation. Anti-maskers have got to be some of the most ignorant people I've ever seen.

Fuck all of this.

I'm, normally a pretty optimistic person who tries to see the glass half-full, but godammit COVID has really made me cynical.

Thankfully  I'm living off-campus with a few friends, so when the next inevitable outbreak and quarantine happen, I won't be alone this time.

It's really been making me really sad to see a majority of my class moving into their dorms these past couple days and hanging out in groups, even if they are masked up and things aren't how they were in the past.

Long rant- sorry

I understand that a global pandemic presents new challenges for all businesses, and some are dealing better than others, but I am beyond frustrated with the college my daughter was planning on attending starting in October. 

It started when we signed up for their Leadership Weekend that was to take place in April. We made all the arrangements a couple of months before (we are in Colorado, the school is in Georgia) and when everything shut down we expected they would cancel. I guess they eventually did, but just a couple weeks before they sent an email asking if we were still planning on attending because they were still holding it. 

Then they told her that because they did cancel they were giving her a $2500 scholarship for her first semester. Then they took it away because she didn't start in July... When she had applied and been accepted to their October semester, not July. 

It seems like every time she calls she can't get ahold of the people she needs to, it takes several messages and emails to get any response. Yk, people working from home and all that. 

She scheduled a phone appointment with her advisor, who called her the day before telling her that she didn't know she was her advisor because they hadn't been assigned yet (though her account listed this woman as her advisor) and it was ""way too early"" for advisor meetings.... This was a week before class registration opened up and about 3 days before she got an email to schedule an appointment with her advisor. 

Almost everyone she talks to can't help her and redirects her to call someone else. This is especially frustrating because no one seems adept at returning calls or emails. 

After looking at their safety protocols dealing with covid, she had decided to see if she could get an exception to their freshmen must live on campus policy for the first semester and take online classes instead. She talked to a few people there about how to do that and the consensus was she could, she just needed an exemption form from housing. No big. 

So she finally got the form she needed and it details the rules of covid exemptions... And says you have to live with a parent or guardian within 15 miles of campus to receive the exemption.  

Obviously she's going to call and see if they can work something out but it will probably take at least 3 days to get ahold of someone. At this point it's really very late to be applying for housing anyways, there's no guarantee she'll be approved, plus making plans to relocate halfway across the country. To add another level of frustration, the school doesn't own their dorms I guess, they are owned by a real estate company, so you sign a year lease. So if she were to move and things shut down or the school moves online like so many have she'll still be stuck in the lease it seems. 

I'm trying to be understanding, but come on. You've had 5 months to figure stuff out. It's going to be $40k/year and she's in a 6 year program.  I'm really starting to question if this sh*t show is worth $240k. (I do understand this is not a lot comparatively, but it's still a decent chunk of change).

TLDR: I'm irritated that my daughter's school doesn't seem to be adapting to the current situation, and neither their cost nor their customer service are reflecting that.",1,1,Revolutionary-Crow49

Lectures have been confusing, the book (while more helpful than the damn lectures) haven't translated well to tests, and everything feels like a blur for this class. The professor has been so far behind that I don't even know what I have to get on the final to pass.  Now I have a relative idea of what I need but that can either be right or severely wrong based on what I've gotten on these online labs, homework, and attendance. 

I've learned many things throughout this Summer quarter, including that moving forward my study habits will need to change, and I will also need to utilize tutors more. And yes you can give me crap for not utilizing a tutor as indeed it was my fault in that sense, but I guess I got used to the classes I took before in which I thought lectures and occasionally having to read the book would be enough.

636,i9de7h,2020-08-14 02:11:04,CollegeRant,I literally refuse to give a presentation ever again,"If you don’t have anxiety regarding speeches you probs won’t understand:/ so just skip 

Howdy, I’ll be finishing up my two year college by next year and I want to go to a private four year college for business management. I am a very social person. I love being around people and I can have a conversation with someone I am not familiar with. Lately, I’ve become more comfortable with interviews. However, I HATE HATE HATE public speaking. I literally hate reading about it, talking about it or even hearing the word ‘presentation’. I had multiple awful experiences in high school. Tired to get over it-made it worse. I read stories and advice of people getting over it but that’s not in my best interest right now. Fortunately, I can take my college public speaking class online! (Yay) Unfortunately, some of the business classes I’ll be taking at the 4 year college have a few presentations. I made a promise to myself that I will NEVER have that level of anxiety or panic again. I will avoid presenting at all costs. I cannot be physically forced to do it. I know it’s unfair to other people who get nervous. And I know it sounds like “hey just get up there for 5 minutes and be yourself”. But to me it is literally the end of the world. I’ve tried therapy, medications and practice but it made it worse. Still like I said I’m very friendly and social until the moment someone says “alright let’s go around the room and introduce ourselves” and I’m internally like”MOM PICK ME UP!!!” Lol  It’s frustrating because it’s taking away the joy and how I am looking forward to college  and making new friends and housing and clubs etc. i will focus on it for hours and research ways to get out of it. Fortunately I can get my MBA online (and I do my thesis online so no presentations there) however for a select few classes there are still some. I am fine with privately talking with a professor and asking if there’s anyway out of it or if I could write a paper or two or three and get partial credit. Or I can see if I can get a form from my doctor that excuses me from them. Seems kinda stupid though because I am social until it comes to that. The good thing is my college is relatively small and hopefully someone there will understand. Has anyone else been able to get out of college presentations? If so how?  Regardless, I am sorry but I am not brave. I am not going to present ever again because of the flashbacks it gives me. I just don’t want my grade to have to drop really low and I seriously want to attend this school. And it seems slightly funny because I’m going for Business Management;however, once again I’m quite social with people (which took me a long ass time I was VERY shy as a kid), but don’t expect me to get on stage anytime soon 😂. And also there’s nothing else I’m really good at or interested in so a BBA is abt my only option :/",7,1,Fluffy_Magazine222

I get making midterms due in the middle of the day if you’re in person or synchronous online. But who in the fuck makes a final essay – which is supposed to be a minimum of 8 fucking pages – due in the middle of the day in *summer*???? People are still traveling because it’s summer and they can’t control what their family wants!!! People have jobs so that they can’t work on essays during the day, and by night, they’re too exhausted to do both our *normal* assignment *and* our final essay. It’s almost impossible to keep up because he wants so much and it’s like, dude, just fucking make it due at midnight, and you’ll get papers that reflect what we’ve learned, not something that we haphazardly threw together because of your fucking demands. Like, seriously!!! It’s one thing to make it due at midnight, I don’t care about that, and it’s one thing to make a test due at class time when there *is* a set class time, but when it’s a work at your own pace???? The fuck???? Why can’t it be due at midnight, or 11 pm, or hell, **9** pm????

And what makes it even more infuriating is I have two professors this summer semester, and one of them is doing great. In fact, I’d almost say his assignments are harder, and they certainly are time-wise, but far more manageable. Our final and midterm essays were clearly outlined by him, and he said that he only wanted 5-6 paragraphs and made the papers be due at midnight. It’s workable. But this other prof, who has the *audacity* to request a minimum of *8 pages* gives us less than enough time to actually write it and makes it due in the middle of the day!!!! It’s not even a class for majors only, so idk what the hell he’s trying to do, make people not want to major in this subject????

AND besides that, he either never responds to emails or he takes ten years to respond and by the time he’s responded to your time-sensitive email, you’ve already worked around it and threw something haphazard together. What a fucking asshole, and I have to take him again in the fall (I didn’t fail this class, I just have to take another major requirement which he teaches). And!!!! It’s the same situation!!!! Online, work at your own pace, finals and midterms due at 2 fucking pm",20,1,myglassesaredrty
638,i7p7q8,2020-08-11 10:16:27,CollegeRant,I’m losing motivation and I don’t know what to do,"I’ve always glorified the idea of college since about elementary school. Growing up I was a kid who liked to tinker with things, and was always doing experiments around the house trying to figure out how things worked and why. It was at about the age of 12 that this, coupled with an interest in aviation and space exploration, made me decide that my goal in life was to become an aerospace engineer. Throughout high school I wasn’t the best student, but I was still above average, and graduated with a 4.2 GPA as a member of the National Honor Society, an AP Scholar, and a Nevada State Seal of Biliteracy in German. It was around my junior year of high school that my entire family started scoffing at my dreams, telling me I wasn’t going to be an engineer and said my real potential was in law or politics. I found this incredibly disheartening to hear but usually just brushed it off and kept doing what I was doing. When I eventually started college at the University of Colorado last year, I quickly found myself woefully unprepared for the rigors of university life. I’d been an AP student and all, but because of the poor teaching quality I had in basically every STEM class in high school, I realized I knew basically nothing of what was essentially unofficial prerequisite knowledge. Whereas my peers had gone to fancy charter schools or had parents who spent thousands on tutors for the majority of their childhood (one girl even published her first research paper at 15), I’d gone through an all-too normal high school experience and found myself in a world designed to cater to the level of those kids. I also learned that I’d never learned how to study and realized I’d spent all of high school flying by the seat of my pants and got good grades by playing a game of luck in a system that had no academic rigor and rewarded simple busywork and memorization rather than actually teaching skills. That semester, I failed all three of my core classes, Calc 1, Computer Science, and Physics 1, and only got B’s in my electives. Nevertheless, I remained vigilant and was determined to pick myself up and move on. The Spring 2020 semester started and I got off to a really good start, but the mid-semester abrupt move to online classes happened and completely obliterated all the gains I’d made in the two or so months I’d been doing well. Once more, I decided to forget about it and keep fighting, so I enrolled in online summer classes, completely ignoring that I’d found out I don’t learn well online. I finally passed both of them, Calc and Physics, but only with D+’s, which despite being passing grades, don’t actually give me degree credit, meaning I have to retake them *yet again.* At this point, I’m really losing motivation to keep on going. If it wasn’t for the fact that I have till December to get my GPA above a 2.0, I’d take a gap semester to wait for COVID to be over, but that’s a luxury I simply can’t have. I know that even though we’re currently slated to go back, we’ll probably end up going back online after an outbreak on campus inevitably occurs, just giving me a repeat of the spring semester. I feel completely lost and don’t know what to do. Considering how poor my GPA is, I don’t think transferring majors, even though I don’t want to do that at all, would solve anything because my transcript’ll just stay the same. I’ve become lowkey depressed lately due to all this, and it’s gotten to the point that what used to seem certain that I would become an engineer just feels like an impossible dream, like Lennie’s rabbits in Of Mice and Men. Anybody on here have any words of advice? Have you ever experienced anything similar? Please let me know.",0,1,TheBryanScout
639,i5krsv,2020-08-07 19:52:40,CollegeRant,University changes on-campus policy 2 weeks before classes start,"This is a short rant about how my university has been flip flopping on us for months now. For context, in May we received an email from the President stating that the Summer 2020 &amp; Fall 2020 semesters will be online, remote learning. Cool, right? 

Well, then in July we get another email, this time telling us that all classes will have mandatory in person instruction with strict social distancing in place. Students will have assigned seating 6 feet apart from each other, everyone must wear masks, hallways will have new walking policies indicating which side we must walk on, classes will only have 20 students in them at a time, and we all must get COVID tested before returning to campus. Out-of-state and international students were left in the dust and essentially were told “figure it out” by our President.

Pretty much everyone hated this and most of my in-state friends transferred to our local community college that is tuition free right now. Today, *two weeks before classes start,* our President has emailed us saying it’s back to remote learning for the foreseeable future. 

I have a surgery scheduled on September 17 and have been told by my surgeon to quarantine until then and for 4 weeks after during my recover my period, this would essentially be the entire semester. So, for the last 3 weeks I’ve been drowning in disability paperwork that I thought I needed to file for my university so I didn’t have to come to class but remain a student remotely. But now it’s suddenly back to remote learning. I wasted so much time trying to figure this shit out and it was all for nothing.",10,1,sky-joos
640,hzv7vl,2020-07-29 05:50:51,CollegeRant,english professor with ridiculous expectations,"long rant. 
i want to start off by saying i have considered the fact that it might just be me - that i'm falling short, not understanding assignments, and in fact i did believe in the beginning that it was solely a me-problem. but as the term went on, it became clear to me that it was not just me who was struggling in class..

this class in particular is engl103 (critical reasoning and writing) it's a standard and required class for all college students regardless of major. 

the professor expects PERFECTION in your essays. i know that's what most professors want, but this professor quite literally nitpicks everything. nothing is ever good enough. to give some context, i have ONLY received D's and one C on my essays in this class. never been able to get a B and surely not an A. i'm no english genius or outstanding student but i have always been able to maintain decent, average grades (usually at least a B) in english classes and never have i ever been scrutinized this much for such minute details in essays. 

i was told that i had the opportunity to revise one essay. the original grade was 68%. after each revision submission, i was told to go back and revise again and again..i ended up submitting four different versions of the same essay with the help of our college's writing tutors. i nearly rewrote the entire thing four times. my final grade of that essay? 75%. i still question whether going through all that was even worth it.. 

to make matters worse, my professor did not provide feedback. in the online gradebook, comments would literally be along the lines of ""this essay needs revision. make an appointment with a tutor."" how was i supposed to know what she wanted me to fix? considering the fact that i submitted these essays with the thought that i DID do everything required+went above and beyond, i was often lost and left to somehow figure it out on my own or just change things that i thought would help. i've bothered the writing tutors with appointments about 8 times for help on every single one of my essays and got good feedback, yet i still only received D's and a C at best on all of them. i'd even have these tutors proofread my essays just before submitting them and they believed my essays were up to standards, if not more. 

it really does something to your confidence when you go through all this and constantly receive shitty grades that do not reflect the effort you put into assignments. it's one thing to not try at all and fail, because at least you know the exact reason why and it's not like you really had anything to lose, but when you put your all into your work and still fail it hits a little harder.

for nearly the entire term i thought it was just me and really beat myself up for it. i seriously questioned whether i was stupid or if i had some sort of learning disability that caused me to miss whatever it was she was asking for on assignments. then towards the end, i noticed other students were actually struggling as well when looking at group discussions on canvas and the responses my professor would give to them. (i didn't know anyone in the class so i couldn't ask if they were going through the same and it's a bit hard to communicate with them personally when everything is online.) this fuelled my curiosity and i went on to the famous RateMyProfessor. lo and behold, i searched up my professor's name, and there they were: terrible reviews with people describing the exact same thing i went through. 

tomorrow she submits the grades for our final assignment. i am sitting on the line right between passing and not passing, and i'm terrified. i feel sick thinking about putting up with everything i went through just to fail this class (and solely the fact that i decided to even take this summer class when i could have taken a break, which my mental health really needed).

642,hxq2pn,2020-07-25 17:01:48,CollegeRant,Is taking a semester off really that bad?,"TL:DR: wanna get my real estate license and debating on taking a semester off to do it. 

Hello everyone, I'm a Sophmore in college and while COVID has made my college strictly online, that isn't actually the reason behind me taking a semester off. The reason why I want to take a semester off is that my real passion and the job I really want is to become a Real Estate Agent. I've already paid $300 for the courses and I've been studying essentially the entire summer to pass my course exams. However, I'm in a little bit of a pickle, unfortunately. So I bought the courses in April, and I only have 6 months (which would be late October) to complete both courses, and you have to pass the first course final to even begin to study for the next course. While I've been studying like a mad-man I also am not sure if I will have enough time to study for the 45-hour course (since it's taken me already till now to even feel ready for the 30-hour course exam). 

So essentially I've been talking to my parents about maybe taking a semester off (because it would be almost impossible to take 5 courses while also studying for my license). Also, I took a summer course to get ahead of my classes, and I realized how difficult it was to even take one college class while also studying for Real Estate because of the studying and amount of terms needed for both classes.

My parents sadly are not fond of me taking a semester off. They think I'll not go back, even though the only thing I really want is to get my license. In a way, I'm not even interested in college anymore and would rather just work on my career, but I'm willing to go back Spring semester so my parents don't feel like failures for raising a ""Drop out"". I'm beyond determined to get my license and honestly it's the only thing on my mind right now. (my summer course was a math class and I confused Multiplicity with a municipality on a homework question and got super confused hahaha). 

Basically, do you think taking a semester off to go after your passion and your goal is really that bad? How many of you have taken a semester off and went back? What can I do to change my parents' mind on this and maybe let them be more willing to let me take a semester off? Will taking a semester off mess with my financial aid or GPA?",12,1,Jmoney_419
643,hxe0hh,2020-07-25 01:14:20,CollegeRant,I’m burned out,"I’m burned out. I came from a dysfunctional homeschooling situation and have loved every minute of being at college. I love my professors. I love learning. It’s made me want to get a doctorate just because I don’t want to stop until I have to. I pride myself on my gpa. My brother once told me that it’s impossible to get a 4.0 in college—so I wanted to prove him wrong, at least at my community college. I’ve had to take 3 years instead of 2 due to switching majors, but I’ve loved being able to take the amount of classes that gave me space to actually learn and not just be there because I have to. One thing I’ve learned though, is that I’m absolutely terrible at online classes. Like, really awful at them. I made sure my long term education plan was for mainly on-campus classes. 

I’m aware that gpa’s don’t really mean anything in the long run. A friend of mine has a 3.9 and got rejected from 8 out of the 10 colleges he applied for. My professors always tell me to stop stressing about it and just enjoy the classes, but apparently I can’t. I’ve developed a hole in the lining of my stomach due to stress, and I barely function during the semester. But during the breaks I miss it dearly, and I’ll I want is for it to go back. 

Now with Covid I’ve lost that place, and this is totally complaining because I’m not sick and I haven’t lost anyone. Shutting down and going online is, in my opinion, exactly the right thing to do for the safety of staff and students. But damn, I’m going to fail. Online classes are my enemy. I don’t know when California/United States is going to get their shit together and fight this, but I have a feeling it’s going to be awhile. I’ve lost my drive. I’m failing my summer class and at this point I don’t want to fight anymore. I don’t care. Even though it’s just one class, I can see myself continuing down this path. 

I want to keep going. I want to succeed and actually do want I’ve set out to do, but it seems unattainable. My friends keep telling me to take an extra year and wait till things are even a little back to normal, but I feel ridiculous taking 4 years to complete a 2 year degree. I’ve been behind all my life in school and seeing all that I’ve worked for go down the drain is awful. I’m apathetic at this point.

645,hta70y,2020-07-18 03:53:54,CollegeRant,Am I being treated unfair by my professor?," So, here's my story.

There's  a class I need this summer to graduate on time (Fall semester). I chose  this class because it was taught by one of my favorite professor. But  she withdrew last minute and was replaced by another professor. This new  professor treats his students like they're in elementary school. I  really don't like his teaching style.

Our  class is totally operated on Zoom due to COVID-19. Then, my brother  asks me to take care of his sons during the class time. I decided to  skip his lecture but still read his ppt files and finish all the  homework and projects on time. But because I skipped his online  lectures, there's 2 quizzes that I missed. I know that it will hurt my  grade, but all pop quizzes are only 10% of the total grade, so I thought  missing 2 quizzes is not a big deal. However, on the morning of the  midterm exam, he posted an announcement saying that those who don't take  the exact 2 quizzes that I missed won't be able to take the midterm.  This requirement was literally made up that morning and nowhere on the  syllabus say so. On the day he gave those 2 quizzes, he said that they  were only to ""prepare the testing environment"" for the midterm exam. The  ""testing environment"" means we need a camera and LockDown Browser  installed on our laptop. That's it. Nothing special. Moreover, I don't  see why we need to ""test the environment"" a week before the exam instead  of the moment right before the exam. I can't understand why that's the  requirement to take the exam. As long as I satisfy all the requirement  (having camera and LockDown Browser), I'm good to take the exam. But no,  at the exam time, when I logged into Zoom (he said in order to take the  exam, we need to attend his Zoom meeting), he kicked me out.

First,  I don't see any mandatory for class attendance in order  to pass this  class (besides the first 2 days of class which I was very  happy to  comply with). From what I see, this professor is doing his  best to make  attending class become the requirement to pass.

Second,   I don't see any requirement from his syllabus saying (either  indirectly  or directly) that in order to take the midterm, I need to  take the pop quizzes.

I brought  this issue to his department but received the reply that he's doing  nothing wrong; that he can change the syllabus anyway he wants; that the  ""prepare"" for the exam is necessary because sometimes the Internet and  the LockDown browser is unstable; participant is important because if I  don't participate in his class and he changes the exam day, I might miss  it as well; I don't take the quizzes so I can't say that if the quizzes  is important for the midterm or not.

I'm  really confused and frustrated right now. So Am I right or wrong?  According to this logic, he's right to stop me from taking the midterm,  right? What should I do now?",23,1,d_wing_d

Business communication (essentially, how to talk like a human person but with unnecessary terminology to remember), writing for business ( exactly the same as the last) Anthropology ( some people eat cows, and some people don't..) and last but not least.... FOOD AND CULTURE. ( In Ireland they eat potatoes, Asian countries they eat noodles and in Germany, they eat fucking sausage.) I'm roughly 1000+ more in debt for each of these fucking wastes of time.

This is the most demanding Bullshit I've ever had to fucking do. At the same time, I'm taking a statistics class which I quite enjoy. But I have to devote 30 hours or so a week to this fucking earth science class, reading 300 pages scattered around a glitchy online textbook just so I can remember for long enough that Volcanoes are formed from FUCKING WHO GIVES A SHIT TO PASS A TEST.

It wasn't until I talked to my friend that I found out you didn't need a pin to register this time, which I had no fucking idea because it wasn't mentioned anywhere and there was no second email.

So I look up the class I need.. and it's full. This one class is a prerequisite for almost every other class I need before graduation and I can't take any of them without this class, or anybody else doing CS for that matter. This is the second fucking time the class has been full that I've tried to register. Last semester it was full within minutes of it becoming available. 3 fucking months until next semester, the class is full, and the wait-list is full (I'm on it).. and I'm fucked.

Also, it's a single fucking class of 40 fucking seats for a university of 20,000 fucking people... You'd think they would have more than a single goddamn class when 20% of students are in CS.

I really don't know what to do. I doubt enough people will drop for me to get in. I really hope they add more than one class for this course before the semester starts. My entire degree is halted because of this one class. It's the prerequisite for every other class I need.

I don't do very well with online classes. Nothing sticks, I procrastinate even more, I've lost my passion for my major, and I cheat. Sometimes I don't show up to class, which is unheard of for me. I've fallen into a depressive spiral. So at first glance it's probably a ""well, duh"" reaction that I should take the semester off. But the main reason I don't want to is because it would completely throw me off track. I'm scheduled to graduate S21, which means the fall and spring will consist of Senior Research I &amp; II (I'm a psych major). If I take a break in the fall and come back in the spring, that means I can't do Senior II and will have to wait until next fall to take the sequence of classes that I still need. What's more, my university is very small and, at this point in the degree, all classes are either fall or spring. So just taking a semester off would mean I would graduate an entire year later. The other reason I wouldn't want to is because of the 6 month grace period for loan repayments. I lost the job I had and I don't know when/if I'll be able to regain it, so unless I threw myself into an environment where I'd most surely get infected, I'd have no means to pay back the loans.  


However, I don't know how the hell I would design and actually complete a whole research project solely online, with the added stress of taking 14 other credits online (17 total). Part of my research idea consisted of observational (qualitative) data. I also just don't have enough trust in myself to be able to put in what would be my normal ""all"" into something so fundamental when it's intangible and something I can't sit down and discuss with my adviser in person. Maybe it's a shitty excuse but Zoom meetings just don't automatically replace in-person meetings for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: If classes go online for the fall, I don't know what I will do. One on hand, I want to stay on track for graduation next spring and I can't personally afford to pay the loans back at this point after the grace period. On on the other hand, I don't know how well I could handle executing my senior research project online.",4,1,love_pendant

The concept we came up with targets online students, and it is designed to work with the calendars used in Blackboard and similar online programs. The concept is that a student can send in the syllabi for their courses and our program will mine the data and put together a calendar schedule for their classes so that they know exactly when assignments are due. And while the instructors could do the same with the calendar, too many don't. We also offer the service (hypothetically) for instructors to keep the syllabi updated for each semester.

Last week it seemed like everyone ignored the groups, but this time the prof emailed the classes asking why, and then before I could send in my feedback.

Even in person, group work sucks. Schedules don't align, peoole have different standards of work, some just slack off entirely, etc. Our class isn't even doing zoom meetings, just recorded lectures.

So I just finished my final semester of my program at college in toronto, and i was set to do a placement for this summer. Before the corona virus hit, i had already locked in a placement and had everything finalized. I have since reached out to the organisation i had arranged a placement with, and they are in demand right now more than ever, and are still happy to take me and have me do my placement over the summer. The ISSUE is, my school will not allow this to count as a credit due to health and safety concerns. are they allowed to deny me my education like this? I am choosing to work in a field that is already dangerous and puts me at risk as it is, so this would give me really good experience dealing with my industry at its worst. And again, the organization really wants to take me. How can the school refuse to give me credit for work that i do that doesnt even concern them? if the organisation still wants me, shouldnt the school be willing to allow me to take part in furthering my education. Its already criminal that i have to PAY tuition to the SCHOOL, in order to work for free as a coop, they literally just sit back and collect my check and put in zero work while i go out and educate myself without their help, now they wont even let me do that? they have offered to allow me to do another online semester of classes, but i signed up for a coop for a REASON. the reason is, working with people is not something you can do online, you need experience.and i specifically picked this course at this school because they offered a coop in my field. and the field i want to work in is one that is almost impossible to get your foot in the door without the experience of a coop. it is unbeleivably frustrating that i have payed this school money, only to have to put in the work to educate myself, i have gone above and beyond to secure a summer coop even with all this going on, and yet for some reason they are going to stunt my education and my eventual career for no reason, even though it makes them money and they dont have to put in any work. Besides, the coop wouldnt even start for a month or two, so how can they already be saying im shit out of luck?

/end Rant

Any help is greatly appreciated, im just really frustrated because ive already lined up other big life plans, such as moving out into a house and whatnot, and the school has just decided to throw it all out the window because they shut down class, even though im not going to class and dont need the school at all, i will be working for a completely separate organization full time, so they have no real reason to make executive decisions on an entirely external situation that doesnt affect them.",0,0,Kugel

This semester I thought I had absolutely amazing professors. All of my classes are higher level (I’m a junior in the US and my classes are all 300-400 level classes right now) and most of them are the only classes my professors are doing this semester due to being hands on and classes for the major I’m in. The school provided two weeks for our professors to switch to online, which for my professors in particular it wouldn’t be hard because their notes and such are posted online anyways. The only thing that would be different would be doing lectures online instead of in class. 

We are now on week three of distance learning and my professors have taken a complete 180. They aren’t responding to D2L discussion chat questions, hosting online lectures during our class hours, responding to emails (it took a week to hear back from a professor over an urgent matter, I resorted to email when he didn’t answer his office phone), and three of my six professors have stopped putting notes on D2L. It’s becoming frustrating as finals are nearing and I don’t feel at all prepared for them. There’s been no provided information on projects, papers, or exams. 

I’m paying $3,500+ for tuition (not adding in other costs) at a school where I’m virtually teaching myself. My professors have also been piling on assignments, which is becoming difficult as us students are struggling to keep up and get help when is needed. I lost power for a few days last week and live in the middle of the rural area in my state, none of the coffee shops are open and I have very little phone service. I emailed my professor to inform her that my paper might not involve the video sources as I couldn’t watch them, she informed me that no power+no where to go watch the videos wasn’t an excuse.",0,3,Eeeeeeeeeeeeeek12

The work has to be online, and I highly doubt they’re gonna suddenly stop assigning all the readings and check ins and summaries because I complained my eyes hurt.

I literally can’t have even one day for my eyes to rest, even on weekends. I can’t drop classes cause I need financial aid money to live, but my eyes keep unfocusing when I try to read.

Basically a couple times I drove all the way to class just for him to be like ""I have a meeting lmfao oops"" and cancelled. 

But now it's worse!! I gave this guy a paper on February 18, just for reference. It still hasn't been graded. I get some teachers are late and it's frustrating, but he's so disorganized. It's been a month and a half. He asked us to hand in the paper physically, because ""emails get all cluttered."" Like ok, I would think at least you can look up an email? We had class around March 9, right before school closed because of Covid. We asked about the paper, and he basically was like ""haha I'll get to it!!""

The whole Covid thing happened, so we transferred to online. He had us resubmit the paper online, so he can post the comments for us. But then we had a Zoom class, and he said he didn't grade it yet because ""computers are so distracting haha."" Like ???? He literally had the physical copy for almost a month, and he didn't grade it, so that's not an excuse.

Also this guy has a different method of writing papers, so I didn't know if I was even doing it right. The comments on the first one would help. He said the second paper and the revisions for the first paper were due the same day. I started working on the second paper, then at the next Zoom class, he cancelled the paper. Then he said all this confusing shit about combining the second and third paper, or I could just do discussion board posts. The paper wasn't even going to be about the material, it was a reflection. And how is a discussion post equivalent to a paper? I think not.

He said ""well I wasn't going to grade your final papers, the grades are done already."" He told us that we had to do the paper/discussion posts so if someone asked, he could show why we have an A. He has said this previously that he doesn't care about our grades, as long as we learn. I'm happy I'm getting an A, but I feel like I haven't learned anything, and it's just frustrating because he's so disorganized. 

Also we're supposed to have discussion leaders, but no one participates. So he just goes on a tangent for like an hour. As time goes on, I can tell everyone is sick of it, because half the class has their mics and cameras off. He's like ""so what do you guys think?"" and like 4 people are actually there. Lately I just lay down or exercise during class, because it's so boring. I'm glad we don't have physical class, because now I can do whatever I want during it.

TL;DR: Professor is so disorganized and it's killing me. He is giving us an A regardless of our actual work, so no one gives a fuck about it.",0,2,OfLittleGrease

**In the interim create a 2-minute video and email to me regarding your progress with the Mandala project (objective/design) and development of your virtual portfolio.  Email your video to me no later than 4:00 PM today, April 8.**

I have no idea what she is wanting and yes this is a bit of a rant because I'm in the fucking hospital for crying out loud. I asked her to clarify but she often takes a while to respond.

They force you to talk to your classmates every single assignment as part of the rubric and it just feels forced even in classes where speaking is the literal subject it doesn't feel as natural as an in-person class. Not only that but some of my professors have made absolutely moronic choices for what they decided would be the conference apps and ways to which we share files even going so far as to avoid the perfectly good school websites just because they were given free reign and told they could choose whatever they felt would help make the adjustment to these emergency online classes easier. This school has went through a ton of trouble to make the website we use every single day user friendly and easy access to anything we need for online studies and yet the usually in-person only professors are told go try whatever you want and they choose useless hack prone and drool filled ways of having us share files and conference with each other just because they can.  *eye twitch* rant over.

662,ftgwcj,2020-04-02 05:50:28,CollegeRant,What incentive is there to be honest on online exams?,"
So tomorrow I have an online physics exam, and it’s free response(we’re given problems, do them on paper, take pics, upload, send them on canvas) you get the idea. They are also closed notes like any exam would be.

However, since they’re obviously online, there’s no way to prevent me or other students from cheating. There’s no required webcam, and while we’re required to take a selfie of our workspace, this doesn’t solve anything for obvious reasons. Technically canvas might be able to track if you tab out of canvas, but almost everyone at our college has multiple electronic devices, and can use those devices to look up how to do problems. 

I had a midterm a couple of days ago and it was all open book and I more or less used google when I couldn’t figure out stuff, but that was fine because it was expected, plus it was ok and everyone did it so it was fair. This is not that. 

I guess the issue I also have is that our classes are basically curved so certain percent of people get certain grades(20 percent get A’s for example, 20 percent get B, etc....)While we’re doing a pass fail this semester , if I get a 70 percent on an exam normally, I’d be fine because that is an average grade. However, with online exams, all the other kids will be able to look up answers, so if they do(and they easily can) and I don’t, I’m penalized because then, the average is going to be a 95+ percent, and my letter grade overall will be worse. If the class wasn’t curved, this would not be an issue, but the class very clearly is. 

It creates a prisoners dilemma situation except in this case my dominant and maximum strategy is to cheat. How is this fair to people that want to be honest but also want to pass, and what would you do if you were in my boots?

I was optimistic this time that it would work in one of my newly-turned-online courses because I had done a test thing and the program actually ran (for the first time ever for me). It also needed to work because, well, it's the only option for me right now.....

I was taking the test and about halfway done when my computer crashed. I think it has crashed maybe one other time before this. That's it. But of course, midway through the test, it crashes.

I then proceed to have a bit of a panic attack and my whole body starts shaking (only one other time in my life has that happened because of stress). I instantly ran and grabbed my phone to email my professor, who then quickly told me he'd allow me to take it a second time (seriously bless the guy) but unfortunately it's making me START THE FUCKING TEST OVER.

665,focfyw,2020-03-24 20:25:22,CollegeRant,I need to vent about this damn group project,"
I just need to vent about how I want to murder this girl in my Biology group. 

Basic relevant info : We got assigned this project over a month ago for my Biology lab. I take my college classes online and am doing Bio and the corequisite lab class this semester, among other classes. We had to be in groups of 5 for this project which were automatically assigned by the professor. She unlocked all the modules at the beginning of the semester so we could work ahead, and assigned the groups basically at the start of the semester, and well over a month before the project was due so we had more then enough time to do it. 

I started a message thread with all the group members in Canvas (our college’s system) so everyone could easily communicate and keep up with everything being said, who was done with what, ask questions/get help, etc. 


I was annoyed to begin with because 3 of the group members kept asking what they were supposed to do and telling them to READ THE RUBRIC clearly wasn’t enough because they kept asking. One of the members finally picks a part to do, and the other guy kept asking so I gave him a choice between the two remaining parts which led him to finally make a decision and get to work. The remaining girl keeps asking and I finally tell her to do the part that’s left because the rest of us are basically done with our work. After saying she’ll get right on it, she then ghosts us. 

We go on to finish the project without her and then continue to wait bc we don’t wanna leave her behind and we have a little bit longer before it’s due. I’m going back and forth between being a nice patient person and waiting for her, and saying fuck this bitch. 

Eventually, the only other group member that’s making an effort to communicate/do any work and I finally decide split her part bc we’re the only ones really doing anything anyway and we just want to be done with it. I’m finishing up/about to put what I wrote for her part in the google doc when she finally messages us back after TWO WEEKS of waiting and says she’ll do the rest of her part. I’m like okay go for it and don’t put in what I have so that she has a chance to contribute to something. Y’all know what that dumbass did?! Copied the numbers/my work from the part I did, and sent it to me in a message asking me to put it in the google doc for her bc she didn’t have her laptop. Copying my work and sending it TO ME is more insulting then just not doing the work at all. I knew we should’ve just finished the project without her and turned it in but nooooo I was trying to be a nice person and be patient and wait. SO ANNOYING.

I had messaged my prof asking if we should leave her name off the project or still keep it on because she wasn’t responding and I didn’t know what to do. Coincidentally after I sent that message the girl finally responded to us. The prof came back and sent me a nice message about how if she didn’t respond to let her know we were moving on without her blah blah blah. I seriously wanna message the prof back and be like “well she finally responded and said she’d so her part, and then proceeded to copy MY work and tried to pass it off as her finished part.” 

I didn’t say anything to the girl when she messaged me “her” work to put in the google doc, but I wanted to be like are you fucking kidding me?!",6,1,trippapotamus

So I need to fill unemployed forms to get unemployment money but I need to send them online, since going there physical is *not* an option... but there are literally like thousands of people in the same taught spot, so the government site just crushed from all the traffic for the entire day. Technically, we've all been sent to a non-pay vacation and we weren't actually fired, but that means suing for non-employment for the weeks we won't be working (i mean, logically, how do shopping centers, coffee shop owners, stores are gonna pay their workers when there are essentially no costumers, so no incoming money, so no revenue? They'll be out of business or will take a loan to recover, won't be able to pay it off and then get out of business.

I breezed through calculus and stats without putting in too much work. so I retook it during interterm with a different professor, got a 69 AGAIN. half of the material was different from the first time I took the class. it was probably not ideal to retake it and cram all the info into 4 weeks. so here we are for round **3** this semester, and I just found out I failed the first exam (three total). it all started to hit me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, not knowing what i'm gonna do after graduation, not being able to pass this stupid fucking class, all this BS with classes being moved online (probably gonna make it harder for this specific class), i am such a fuck up and I am so confused with life right now. I've been in constant contact with the professor, went to his office hours, and I just so embarrassed I can't get my shit together.

i'm really sorry i just had to vent and get all this shit off my chest. no bs, time to saddle up and take pure action. i literally don't care if I have to do the same fucking problem sets over and over again, read to the fucking bone, haggle this professor for days in his office hours I WILL FUCKING PASS AND MOVE ON WITH MY FUCKING LIFE. I just went to the gym, went on a 3 mile run and made some coffee and I'm about to go at it! please everyone stay safe with the virus around, hug your loved ones/elders, ONLINE CLASSES WON'T STOP ME and let's get after it and rock this world!!!!!!!!!

670,fhooxb,2020-03-12 22:11:27,CollegeRant,My college is starting mandatory home online lessons instead of making attendance. Guess why.,"Because my country is trying to stop the spread of COVID-19 while we still have like only hundred patients. Seriously, we jumped from 25 patients to 80 overnight a few days ago (if the media is to be trusted). So they cancelled grade to high schools for a while and everyone coming back from oversees from EVERY COUNTRY goes to immediate house isolation (since that's sorta how we missed so many people who came into the country and had the virus to begin with). As far as the Academy goes, they don't want more than hundred people gathered in one class, so maybe these home online lessons won't apply to my classes because we're about 50 and so far everyone is perfectly healthy...

But I *SWEAR* if my shitty family WiFi disconnects because someone from my ~~shit~~ family does something to steal my bandwidth I'm gonna crush their computers with a goddamned hammer THEY WON'T EVEN SEE ME COMING!

Seriously though, I can deal with being stuck at home or my academic career taking a nasty turn like that, but I'm scared shitless about my job. I work in a restaurant. We sort of depend on costumers coming in. 

(And yes, things are gonna go *so* wrong with these online lessons. I'm not even sure every student has wifi or even a computer at home. You'd think everyone does since it's 2020 but there are few adult middle-aged students in our classes who still use fucking windows XP. They know how to use an Iphone and the college site but even that is stretching out their knowledge of the use of modern technology.)",2,1,Mandarine221

673,fh7034,2020-03-11 23:54:46,CollegeRant,Classes all being moved to online format — don’t know whether this will help or hurt my chances of getting this internship,"So I applied to an internship early February and had an interview late that same month. They were looking for someone who could start right now, but my class schedule didn’t allow for me to do that until May. Now that classes are moved to online only for the rest of the semester, I took a chance and emailed the HR lady I interviewed with giving them the news. 

Before they told me they were going to continue with interviews in case they did find someone who could start ASAP. I thought that if I expressed there was a high possibility I could start very soon, they would consider me more seriously. I don’t know whether they think this is premature or proactive, but I REALLY need this internship. 

They’re paying really well and it’s not far from my home. I’ve applied to so many other internships and this is the only interview I actually received. If I don’t get this, I don’t know what I will do. I haven’t had a job that’s paid more than $8.00 an hour and I’ll be making twice that if I get this. 

I plan on taking a month to go to St. Petersburg to study abroad next summer which will be before my senior year, so this summer I need a stable job that can continue through my junior year.

674,fg4c6a,2020-03-09 23:42:34,CollegeRant,"So tired of being told to ""build a relationship with your professor""","For reference, I'm taking Mathematical Structures (MAT300) at ASU.  This is one of the first classes I've had at university where the class size is less than 35.  I am not a huge fan of the professor or his teaching style, but to be fair I never have been ecstatic or even pleased with my professors.  In fact, I don't pick my classes based on professor since they all seem to be equally not great.  This professor tends to ramble about one subsection of the intended lecture for about half the class period.  From my perspective, this seems to be due to the fact that the same question gets asked by the class in several different ways (indicating that the professor isn't answering questions adequately).  I personally have been able to struggle/learn through the notes/internet and haven't yet gone to a tutor, but it's a big struggle.  I've been diagnosed with general/social anxiety, so I personally find it easier to solve my own problems rather than suffer through the anxiety and embarrassment of going to a tutor.  I've considered going to the professor when I'm struggling with assignments, but as I've said his style of communication doesn't work very well for me, and the idea of having a 1-on-1 with a professor drives the anxiety through the roof.  What really angers me is that everyone I've asked about this issue tells me some version of the following: ""You need to develop a better relationship with the professor.  They are a vital resource in your learning, and having this relationship with the professor will definitely translate to higher grades!""  In my mind, this is absurd.  Why should my ability to pass a class be dependent on how much ass I can kiss?  I have no interest in social interaction with a professor.  I see them as a knowledge resource, not as a potential friend or even acquaintance.  I understand that a lot of people believe that mastering the student-professor dynamic is vital to future success in an employee-boss situation.  While I think there is some merit to that, I (at least anecdotally) have not experienced this to be the case.  I'm working part time in my field of study (Comp Sci/Software Development), and I've never had any trouble interacting with my bosses.  I'm well liked and reliable, and haven't experienced any issues.  In fact, I'd much rather sit down and have a discussion with my boss than any professor.  Thus, for me, the two are not mutually exclusive.  This brings me back to the fact that my success in the course seems to be more based on how much I can get the professor to be positively disposed towards me, and the actual performance in-class is less important.  Why do people think in this odd manner?  Why am I paying out the ass for a class that is supposed to help me develop my mathematical skills when the seemingly much more important grading factor is people skills?  If I wanted to develop my interpersonal skills, I would have taken a class in that venue.  The enraging part is that this is by far not limited to this class.  Every time I've struggled through any class, I've always been told to start sucking up to the professor.  I've just never paid much attention to that recommendation.  I was able to struggle my way through the likes of all of calc, linear algebra, differential equations, basic chemistry, composition, etc. without ever meeting the professors for those classes and without going to a tutor.  This class is feeling a bit different since online resources are becoming more limited, and since it feels like the class is specifically engineered to force you to rely heavily on the professor and tutors.",0,1,intoxicatedMobyDick

I’m F24 and my professor M30. I’m an education student, and my professor is currently a doctoral student. He’s married, and I’m gonna be getting married in the next couple years, so I don’t plan on doing anything wild and breaking them up or anything like that. I’m usually a very outgoing, and loud person during class discussions, but I can’t seem to talk very much during his classes. (The classes that I have with him are about six students) I get very nervous, and feel the need to impress him. I will go out of my way to make good discussion posts online, and show up to extra credit events to prove to him that I am a good student. This week I was the only one to remember to turn in an assignment, and he made sure to announce during class that I was the star student that remember to turn it in.
Later I needed to gather materials for a lesson, and I asked him if I could get into the building early in the morning. He gave me his number and told me to text him when I was on my way to pick up materials and he would meet me. I know he’s just doing his job, but !! I was nervous to text him. I know that’s childish. 

I feel like there’s a strange tension between him and I. I understand that it is a small class, so making eye contact isn’t anything special to just me, but it always gives me butterflies. During class discussions pop culture is a regular topic, and I find that him and I both get excited about a lot of the same things. During that time, will share with each other our interests. Now bear with me, I know this will sound silly: I have a multicolored pen that I use to colorcode all my notes. This week while he was helping me he picked up my pen and said,“Oh! My wife would love a pen like this.” which I already knew, and later that day he asked if I had plans for spring break I made a point to talk about my partner and our up coming vacation.

I think I’m just drawn to him because he reminds me so much of my partner, and it makes me nervous, as well as makes me anxious to impress him. (I should also add that my partner is a teacher)

676,f6x5wx,2020-02-20 18:18:08,CollegeRant,Dropped two classes my first semester in College.,"So, I started school in January of this year. I was taking 5 classes:

Financial Accounting, Intro to Business, College Algebra, Intro to Philosophical Reasoning and Written Communications.

I was warned by my friends that it was going to be difficult to balance all of those classes and turn assignments in on time. I thought I could do it because I figured that if I could manage turning assignments in on time for high school, then I would be fine in college. I was wrong. I fell behind in my financial accounting and intro to business classes simply because of procrastination and because of my two jobs. I definitely regret it. But I managed to get sort of caught up. My college algebra class was going fine until I noticed how many assignments my professor wanted due every week. I looked at the rest of my classes and I realized I wasnt going to be able to do all these assignments on time.  I decided to drop my algebra class because it really was a lot of homework for me to do + the other classes I had on top of that. So I went into our advisory office and dropped the class. They told me it would count as one attempt and the next I have to make sure I pass. Me being the sensitive person I am, I walked to my car in tears and bawled my eyes out once I got in the car. I felt like a disappointment to my parents since they're the ones paying for my education. I was emotional the whole day. I messaged a couple friends about it and they kept telling me ""Its okay, college is difficult and that professor really does expect too much from students."" Thats same day a friend and I went to eat at zaxbys and managed to clear my mind off of things for a bit. I also told my parents and they seemed a little upset but understanding. Two weeks passed by and I felt a little more caught up. Although I was still behind in my financial accounting class. I have difficulty with understanding how record transactions, balance sheets and what not. Im trying my best, but I found out that my Midterm for that class is coming next week and is due on March 1st. I figured that if i studied enough, I could get at least a C+. I then looked at the study guide and realized that I wouldnt be able to study on time to pass. I thought, since its online, I can just use my notes and pass easily. But im not sure if the test is timed or not. I then thought about my other classes and how much work i had to do for them and decided that maybe I should drop my accounting class as well. And I did. I feel terrible for it and I know I shouldn't because some people cant take on so much work. Im planning to tell my parents later tonight. I hope they understand why. My parents noticed how many notes I would take and how much time I dedicated to my accounting class.But I can say I feel a little less stressed about my first semester. I can focus on my upcoming essay thats 1600 words, My philosophy class readings, and I can focus on my Business Plan thats has to be about 9 pages long 😳 this is a lot to read and its probably confusinf as freak but i just needed to get this off my chest.

Requesting moral support, similar experiences and maybe brainstorming.","Hey all, this is pretty long but I could use some feedback. I go to school 100% online, so I can't ask other students for their thoughts. My entire class is based around one argumentive paper we are working on all semester. I got my first thesis approved, the professor said it was perfect. But after two weeks suddenly I get an email saying it wasn't going to work, I wouldn't have enough sources to argue the topic. I was annoyed since I'd already put in several hours on the assignment. But, the professor is always right; I changed my thesis. The professor said my new thesis was amazing, I shouldn't have any problems with that. It was all As on everything I turned in. Three weeks later I had written the main argument, it was pretty solid, I've gotten excellent grades for a lot less. I was stunned when I got the lowest passing grade  possible. There were lots of comments growing steadily more negative as I built my argument. The comments stopped halfway through, the last comment was my paper was not subjective. Throughout the comments the professor challenged the legitimacy of the studies several times, saying she didn't believe what my sources said was true. A simple check would have confirmed they were correct. The professor threw out all the first hand accounts saying they were biased, dispite the fact they were objectively written observations made by experts. The professor threw out all the websites, because they were websites. It left me with two studies to support the first half of my argument. I didn't really care about the topic before, but now I'm upset. I worked hard, everything was correct, this professor didn't even bother to check! I made one grammatical error. I feel like my argument really hit a nerve and that's why I got the poor grade. I sent a nice email saying, I'm confused, all these sources are subjective? The professor said that only scientific studies can be used. I wanted to do some serious swearing, but I politely said I understood and would change my topic.
Yikes! I'm over halfway through the semester with no paper and no ideas. I'm supposed to find a topic where I have enough current scientific studies that disagree to support an argument, preferably something that doesn't make the professor uncomfortable. I can't think of anything. All I can think of is typing a very argumentative email to my professor.

678,f2uixx,2020-02-12 17:16:58,CollegeRant,Seeking guidance,"I go to community college in Northern California (CS major) where one of my math professors decided to to drop all the students in the class that hadn't signed atleast 3 hours worth into an assignment online that's due in 2 weeks. We are only in our 3rd week of the semester and I wasn't even aware that I had been dropped until showing up to class this week (haven't missed a day), there also was no notice of people being dropped from the class. I confronted here after class in which she got super defensive and she said that it's her policy (not in the syllabus) and she said that if I do it before the deadline she'd add me back to the class in which I could go through the process of paying for the class again. I asked her if I could get something that would guarentee that I would be added back to the class when I finish the assignment and attend class for the next 2 weeks and she went on a rant of how I'm question her and the professors integrity of the school (I was very calm the whole time, I just want to stay in the class) I then tired of the conversation, seeing that it would only get worse, I just agreed to do the assignment and left it at that. 

Question is: Should I attempt to continue with her class? (I don't want to get a semester behind)  I'm a little hesitant now, out of 35 students, we've already lost about 10 people in the 3rd week for an easy math class (college algebra)",4,1,Shunthunt

I have a professor that does not teach jack shit. ~160 kids in this class, there's only 2 TAs and 1 prof. The purpose of this class is to do all the work on your own outside of class, then show up for questions. How the fuck am I supposed to ask questions if there's 159 other kids raising their hands asking questions? I swear to fuck I spend the entire class with my hand raised waiting for a TA to show up. I send emails and they don't get answered. The best resource is other students. 

I have another prof, she is the ONLY professor who teaches a specific class which is required for my degree. There is no other option. I had an online (auto graded) assignment marked wrong, I sent her proof that I was right, and I didn't get a reply. I come into class *6 fucking days later* and confront her, and I asked ""did you receive my email or did I send it to the wrong person?"" and she says she got it but didn't read it. Well okay, a day or two or 3 is understandable. A fucking *week* later and still no reply (and no reply to this day, 10 days later) is fucking absurd. My grade still hasn't changed.

I had another professor 2 semesters ago (spring 2019), and once again, I got an answer marked wrong that was correct. Emailed this lady and she replied standing by her typo and told me tough shit, you still got it wrong. This is for a programming quiz (data structures). A typo is the difference between right at wrong. ""quizBank"" is NOT the same as ""quziBank"", those are 2 completely fucking separate variables. She ignored all further emails, which I made very polite because my grade is in this woman's hands. This lady did not do anything at all except 1 quiz a week based on zybooks. The midterm and final were proctored, not by the school, so we had to pay out of pocket to take our fucking exams. $60 I wasn't expecting to pay, which isn't too bad, but why the fuck do I have to pay for that? There's no resources on campus for proctored exams? Fucking seriously? I can say I learned absolutely nothing at all about data structures but still somehow got a B. Fuck you [removed], you're fucking lazy and absolutely useless. Google her and check out that fantastic rate my professor rating. Edit I changed my mind on putting her name.

Financial aid. I met with a financial aid bursar lady fall 2018 who was reluctantly helpful. She sighed and sounded annoyed that she found me a $500/semester grant. Great! Any little bit helps, thank you! I only got this grant for 1 year. Last year, spring 2019, I went to meet with her only to find out she doesn't meet with students anymore. Neither does anyone in financial aid. Their whole office was relocated to another building. So I go and find out *other STUDENTS* are now handling finances. Fantastic, what's better than a barely paid 19 year old handling my finances? Them bullshitting every fucking question I ask them. They don't know the fucking answers. I call them out and say it's okay to say you don't know something, but don't fucking spread misinformation, especially on something that cost me $1000 a year and other students thousands as well. Fuck you. Now that grant I had is seemingly ""lost"", I can't meet with anyone over the age of 20, and I'm genuinely fucking annoyed. Some of these kids want to be helpful, but it's like they're trained to tell you whatever answer comes off the top of their fucking head at that moment. ""hmmmm *I think* it's because -blahblahbullshitanswer-."" I've almost had to drop out on multiple occasions due to a lack of money. I got denied every federal and private loan. I applied for around 6 private loan companies. Federal is determined by the financial aid office, except parent plus which I was denied on with both my parents. My credit is great, 730, I've had an auto loan for $35k and I paid it off entirely (and my credit dropped because now my average age of credit is lower lmfao) and apparently that doesn't mean shit. My parents have $300,000 and $40,000 in student loans for my sister's private college loans, so I can't get money, my younger brother went to the military because he can't get help and had no money of his own, and now my younger sister who's still in HS doesn't believe me when I say she has to work, make money like I did, and pay your own way through college as you go. There is no money or loans that will magically appear. Just as you scrape by to pay the tuition by the due date, you're fucked in the ass with $400 in access codes and out of pocket housing / food costs. 

Back to access codes. Nearly every professor requires zybooks, Pearson mylab, wiley plus, or some other dog shit software that the students are required to pay for. Why are we paying the university and then paying a 3rd party to do our homework? These companies are determining the fucking prices. If the prof says ""we're using zybooks, this is the code"", there is *No. Other. Choice*. You are forced to pay whatever zybooks/pearson/wiley/whoever says you gotta pay. $60? $90? $120?? Pay it or fail. Textbooks are no longer as widely used because kids pirate them because they're charging $200 for a fucking textbook. What is the fucking incentive for these professors to be using this software? Zybooks is absolute shit. Complete one section, get to the next, and all the answers from last section are gone. There's no penalty for getting anything wrong. There is no learning going on here. It's only useful for information, but it even fucking sucks at that because it doesn't go in depth on anything.

680,ez6gdz,2020-02-05 08:30:28,CollegeRant,"Am I spreading myself too thin, or am I just lazy and bad at time management?","*TLDR: just read the bullet lists and bolded part lmao*

I'm a third year student and I'm finding it more and more difficult to keep up with my schoolwork this semester. I've never been the best at time management, but now I'm losing so much sleep (having to pull an all-nighter at least 2-3 nights every week to do my homework, and even then I usually don't complete it entirely), I'm falling behind because I can't find time to read my textbooks, I skip several classes every week to work on other homework, have no time to be social &amp; maintain my friendships, and I'm still not getting the grades I want. It seems like I just won't be able to pass my classes unless I give up an unhealthy amount of sleep. It feels kind of impossible to improve at this point even though I'm trying so hard. I'm so sick of being sleep deprived!

I think I'm objectively a very busy person and don't have a ton of free time, but I'm wondering if maybe I'm just being lazy and not using my time well. Or maybe I'm not smart enough for my major and it's impossible because I don't pick up concepts quickly enough?

Here's what my life is like right now:

* Double major in physics and astrophysics, plus an arts minor
* Enrolled in 17 credit hours, 15 of which are upper level physics/astro courses
* Working 2 part-time jobs and a research position, about 25 hours a week combined
* On exec board of two student organizations, taking up about 5-15 hours of my week

It seems like a lot more in my head than when I actually write it out, but I just don't understand how I can keep up. On most days (including weekends) I have classes and/or work from 9am to 5pm\~7pm. Then I might have rehearsals in the evening for an hour or two. Sometimes I even have work til 10 or 11pm. Where am I supposed to find this time to get all my schoolwork done?

This is my typical schoolwork for a week:

* 3-4 big assignments (problem sets, lab reports) that take 10-12+ hours each
* About 20 sections (not chapters) of reading assigned (in all classes combined)
* Two online quizzes due four days a week
* A couple miscellaneous assignments for my minor, my research, or applications to work on for summer internships/research programs

Most weeks I have maybe 3-4 ""good"" night's sleep (5+ hours), the rest are sleepless or 1-3 hours. And I'm still not getting the grades I want (by a long shot)!

**So I guess my question is, am I over-committing myself and really don't have time, or is this totally doable and I'm just not using my time wisely? And does anyone have any tips for maintaining such a busy schedule? Where do I go from here?**

I think it would be a good idea to drop some things from my schedule, but I don't think I can. I don't think I'll graduate on time if I drop a class (I just added my second major before my third year, so I have some catching up to do), I absolutely can't quit two of my jobs (one is research so it's very important to my future, the other is teaching and I now have a commitment to my students until June), I can't drop my student org/club (I'm on exec board, have important commitments until April)... This leaves a few things I can drop to make time: My third job, my minor class, or my sleep. I love my third job more than anything, my minor class is a much needed break (and only takes up \~5 hrs a week), and apparently I need to sleep to survive. Basically the only things I can drop from my schedule are all the things that keep me sane through all of this lol. I've already dropped my social life basically...

I'm sorry for the super long post/rant, it's just really stressful and I'm not sure if I'm crazy for doing all this stuff or if I'm stupid/lazy for not being able to do it all. It feels like a miracle that I'm even still holding on, but also a huge disappointment that I'm not doing better in every aspect. I guess I'm just looking for other people's opinions or advice if you've been in a similar situation. Thanks in advance :')",4,1,ChmessReferee

682,eyjuj6,2020-02-04 03:47:24,CollegeRant,Is this insane or am I just stressed? I feel like it’s insane.,"So, typical background info : I don’t typically have issues with my classes and this has never really happened before. I usually get A’s and the occasional B. My “problem” class is currently English, which is usually my strongest subject and I usually consider these easy classes. All my classes are online currently. It’s a 16 week class done in 8 weeks, and I’ve taken this type of “short” class before so I’m familiar with the format and extra work that needs to be done. However....

This is the one professor I didn’t check on ratemyprofessor and I’m highly regretting it.

The first week she wanted 4 assignments due by Wednesday, which, sucks but whatever. Except our college got hacked and the program that we do our classes on was down for most of the week. Except for about an hour on Monday, (I got booted and then couldn’t log back in) I couldn’t even log in until Thursday and honestly didn’t even have a great grasp of what the hell was going on in any of my classes due to being booted Monday (the day they started). All my professors pushed back due dates except her, she “doesn’t accept late work” and I had to basically beg to let her let me turn them in, although I wasn’t the only one with issues.

Now...we’re in the second module and she wants us to put together a debate. Okay, cool, no problem. We have to do the whole debate by ourselves even though we’re on a “team.” Again, no problem. This is what she wants :
We have to plan out the whole introduction, debate, refutation and summary and they all have to be 2-3 pages and are due Thurs(intro), Fri(debate), and Saturday(refutation). Sunday she wants the summary due (also 2/3 pages), 2 “labs”, and one “lab” is a sheet we have to fill out on everyone else’s debates and who won/lost and it’s pretty detailed, the other one has to be 300 words +, an annotated bibliography (15-20 sources in alphabetical order and with at least a 150 word summary for each source) and then we have to write a paper on the whole experience (in addition to the debate summary) that has to be 2/3 pages. 

I feel like this is an insane amount of work for one week, especially to be due back to back. I’ll admit this isn’t an ideal time for me bc my husband is out of town for work all week so I have the baby (almost two) by myself and three other classes (2 with labs) to do so I’m kinda feeling the stress as it is and want to know ...am I just stressed or is this kind of insane?! I keep debating dropping this class but I’ve never had to drop before so idk. I half just needed to vent but fuck man.",1,1,trippapotamus
683,exgp6r,2020-02-02 01:46:38,CollegeRant,How do I decide on an online class. I guess on the first quiz and didn't study ANYTHING at all and got a 25/25. I was hoping I would find out how hard the class is but I can't tell if it's like easy or if the first quiz is just easy. I need to decide in a couple days.,Ugh any suggestions on pros and cons of an online class or any worksheet to see if I'm the type we can do this?,1,1,Ihavequestions_toask
684,evx7yv,2020-01-30 01:29:24,CollegeRant,English isn’t my English professor’s first language.,"I was willing to give benefit of the doubt thinking that perhaps this might give the professor an edge on English from learning it in a class setting. But I think I need to ask for my money back on this course.

Today a student spoke up and asked a question that had been on my mind about why our questions had been marked wrong for selecting “they/their” instead of “him/her” on a multiple choice - finish the sentence question that didn’t indicate the person being spoken about’s gender.

The professor argued that they/their is only correct for spoken vernacular. However the current online Oxford dictionary disagrees with the professor. So now I guess we are bringing in the Dean of MLA into this conversation because gender pronouns haven’t been used by any one in a long as while.",3,1,MehWhuteva
685,ev1xpp,2020-01-28 06:43:36,CollegeRant,It is only the third week,"And I am already exhausted, it is my first semester taking more than three classes. I am stressed about my homework which I couldnt finish tonight. Its about Coding, we did the exercise earlier today but I forgot the exact things to type, now I have to go to school tomorrow and ask for help before the work is due at midnight. My biology HW is also due on Wednesday, I finished it earlier tho. I also need to start the assignments for that online class, which is due next friday. Its making me feel a tad overwhelmed. I know I didnt expect college to be easy, I have been before but I left. I know I am preaching to the choir here. I just wanted to vent tonight.",4,1,mikeweasy
686,euvth3,2020-01-27 22:37:41,CollegeRant,Is this ethical?,I'm attending a community college online and set to graduate with my AA next semester. I am taking a full schedule and this Human anatomy class with lab is an 8 week course. I have completed 8 week courses this entire time. This class specifically started jan 21 and week 1 assignments were due jan 22 and week 2 assignments done jan 26. I have to take a proctured test at campus that is scheduled the 28th and the test covers weeks 1-4. Week 3 assignments are due jan 29. It took me 6 hours to complete the homework online sunday for simply just week 2. This is a filler credit class for electives. The teachers office hours are mon-thurs 11am-1pm. They havent even responded to any emails I have sent.,3,1,imaslap900
687,et0ia2,2020-01-23 22:19:24,CollegeRant,I just had to pay 500 dollars for a class I haven't ever attended,"I was placed in a class last minute after the registrar noticed I was an hour short of graduation. I realized the same day that I could not afford the course, so I found some random online course elsewhere that was 1500 dollars cheaper. When I went to speak with the registrar, I was sent away with a form and was told that emails would not be accepted. I returned the transfer approval form the next day(Thursday)  but they didn't get back to me until the following Tuesday (the second week of classes) giving me the okay to drop the class. By this point, I had yet to attend the class because it conflicted with another class I am taking, the drop period had already ended, and my professor was nowhere to be found. I needed his signature to drop the course, but he was not responding to emails and was never in his office during office hours. I was finally able to convince the receptionist to sign it in his place. Today, I look at my student account and see that I still have to pay 500 dollars (25% of the class) because I dropped during the second week. Again, I never even got a chance to attend the class and was trying to drop since the first week. I'm so frustrated right now.",3,1,gingermoonx
688,em3box,2020-01-09 02:41:29,CollegeRant,I just want to drop out for my own sanity.,"I have 60 credits at a university and let me just say that these past 2 years or so have been pure hell. Not one thing has gone smoothly. Every semester it's the same bull; oh, you have a hold on your account until you sit down with an advisor who is going to tell you what you can easily find in 2 minutes on your student account. They offer so many classes! 3 out of the 4 open are the same professor with terrible reviews and they're all at horrible times. This semester I tried to sign up for an online class and apparently it's reserved for fully online students only despite there being several seats open. I work almost 50 hours a week, I very rarely find an in-person class that fits my schedule so I rely heavily on online classes. Guess that required class isn't happening anytime soon. 

My university is proudly displaying that they provide free housing AND tuition to homeless students and refugees. I'm all for helping people, but please explain how that is fair to those of us paying out of pocket?

I'm majoring in accounting, or so I thought. You'd think that at the start of my Junior year I'd have a fairly good idea of accounting concepts and I'd be preparing for an internship or job in accounting or something to that extent. But instead I've been taking things like geology, music appreciation, college algebra, and english composition courses which have absolutely nothing to do with accounting.  And here's a genius idea; my school requires you to take an accounting entrance exam during your Junior year. They give you 2 chances, and if you fail both times, guess what? Now the university will shove their diamond studded fist up your ass and throw excess credit charges at you because now you have to switch majors! Because, you know, wanting to take more classes and learn more is a negative thing in the eyes of the university. If you take any longer than 4 years to graduate they can't gloat about how most of their students graduate in 4 years. 

I'm on the verge of dropping out because thinking about college makes my blood boil. I've made the Dean's List almost every single semester, but I've had enough of this hell.",2,1,tropicalYJ
689,ejtt4o,2020-01-04 07:54:52,CollegeRant,College would be easy...,"If I didn’t have to take multiple weeder classes in the same semester to still graduate early (AP credit puts me a year ahead).

If I didn’t have to have internships (that eat daylight like they don’t know you have classes/a job) at the same time as those weeder classes.

If my dad would either help me out financially or finally admit that he can’t, instead of keeping me on edge for 2 fucking semesters living paycheck to paycheck and getting the odd $200 from him occasionally.

If my dad wouldn’t have put me in an apartment that’s way too expensive for this fall semester anticipating a big payday that has yet to come in.

If I could honestly believe at this point that the aforementioned paycheck is actually going to come in.

If my dad would acknowledge my concerns over this instead of treating it like I just don’t have faith in him/god/whatever the fuck and blowing me off.

If I could just get through this 23-person waitlist and not be in a class with a shitty prof at 8 am as a fucking junior, and be in the easy online version.

If I could just be out already and have a job for fucks sake. I already know how to do a decent job at my major-specific stuff.

If I wasn’t forced to go into debt for it. That’s probably the worst part.

I honestly kinda fucking hate college rn. Being this broke is the absolute worst. I’ve had to rely on handouts for too goddamn long. I haven’t felt financially safe in what feels like a lifetime. I just wish I could start earning and saving money and being self sufficient and never have to rely on my parents for anything ever again. They’ve promised a lot, and they let me down big time here.",2,12,AllThotsAllowed
