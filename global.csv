5545,fs93q7,2020-03-31 08:15:31,tifu,TIFU By not muting myself in an online class,"So, I have a parrot and online classes. We are not required to have video in the online class, so we just connect our microphones. Today, my bed, was extremely comfortable. As I got up at 10 am to join the online meeting in Zoom, my bed started calling me. I fucking felt it. I joined, and didn't mute myself. Normally I'd mute myself because I have a parrot. My parrot is an Indian Ringneck, and those bastards are loud as fuck. I decided to fall asleep through the whole class as my bed felt so good.  Only after I woke up an hour after the class I realised I was still in the meeting with an unmuted microphone. I texted one of my classmates and they told me they couldn't have a normal class, and the teacher didn't know how to kick me out. They also said they tried talking with the parrot, they told me he said ""Hello"" and ""What you doing"" and then proceeded to repeat ""ok"" for the duration of the class. 

TLDR: I joined my online class, forgot to mute myself, slept, and my parrot was screaming all throughout it.",893,1,TcpAckFrequency

2488,k6efzj,2020-12-04 05:15:41,tifu,TIFU by accidentally meowing for two straight minutes in my online class,"So today in my bio class I was taking screenshots of the slides, and my teacher changed the slide too fast for me to take a picture, so I made a small distress noise. Little did I know that I had forgot to mute after my last question, and everyone in the class heard it. But my bio teacher thought it was A CAT, and immediately said, ""Is that a cat? Who brought their cat? Show your petS!!!!!!"" And then I just DIED of laughter, because that sound was ME, and it all came from because I forgot to mute my mic, because trust me, I would NOT have made that noise if I knew I was unmuted.

If that wasn't worst enough, I then went onto a discord server, and told everyone about what happened. To add to the story effect, I then tried to record the exact sound I made.... which meant I was trying out different ""meows."" BUT I STILL WASN'T MUTED IN THE GOOGLE MEET! So everyone heard me meowing for two straight minutes. What makes THAT even worse is that I only knew I wasn't muted when I checked the group chat I had with my bio class, with my classmates asking me if I was ok, and that's when I realized I forgot to mute A SECOND TIME.

I honestly don't think I can live this one down.... I may or may not have to switch schools lol

1766,lb33c9,2021-02-02 18:45:53,AmItheAsshole,AITA for breastfeeding while on an online class?,"I had my daughter, ""Faith"", last summer. While I have her on a schedule, sometimes this schedule gets deviated from, like today. Because my neighbours suck, Faith was up all night, so while I normally feed her before my class and have her take a nap during class, today Faith ended up falling asleep before I fed her. She then woke up about 1 hour into my 2 hour class, and she was hungry, so I fed her.

I was off camera and my microphone was muted, just my lecturer was on screen, and all questions and comments were being done through text. I kept typing my responses wrong because I was doing it all with my non dominant hand, and my friends were joking about it in our group chat. I responded that it was hard to type while breastfeeding, which is how they found out what I was doing.

At the same time as this, there was a discussion in the larger group chat with the entire class about someone else making typos because they were also cooking dinner, and someone else responded that they were on the treadmill while listening to the class. One of my friends in the first chat then responded ""lol you're cooking OP is breastfeeding and they're on a jog this is the weirdest class ever"" or something to that effect, meant as a harmless observation.

People picked up on the bit about me breastfeeding. I apologised, saying the neighbours were pricks and now Faith's feeding/sleeping schedule is all over the place and I figured as there was no camera/mic then no one would mind. Someone responded that it would have been nice to be informed because being on the class is weird now, and someone else agreed, adding that I could have at least asked if they were OK with it. They also added that at nearly 8 months old, Faith is able to eat actual food and I could have just given her that. I didn't do this as I planned to give her solid food after class, and the milk was just meant to tide her over until then, but when I said this, someone said I should have just left the class as the lecturer, being a mother herself, wouldn't have minded.

It escalated from there and now the whole class is split in 2, with about 2/3rds feeling that I'm an arse for breastfeeding while on the class, that me hiding it is dodgy, and that I really should have checked before doing this, that if I had to feed her I could have fed her something else, and that if I wouldn't do this during an in person class, why did I feel it was appropriate to do here? The rest either feel it isn't their business or that this is dumb because my mic/camera were off and Faith has to eat.

Was I TA?",593,544,Aggravating_Dish_488

So she asked me if she could come to my (29M) place for her classes since I have internet. They’re in the mornings after I leave for work so I had to give her an extra key so she can go in when I’m not there. My ONLY rule was absolutely make sure to lock the door before you leave. Idk what it’s been such an issue. It’s serious for me because in my neighborhood there’s been more break ins the last couple years. Luckily it hasn’t happened to me because I take precautions. All my windows have locks with an alarm.l, cameras at my door and each window. On 3 different occasions my sister had left my place with the windows open or door unlocked. Again no idea why it’s not an issue to remember to lock a door or close and lock a window you just opened. It seriously pissed me off. I’m a jeweler. I bring my work home with me. Gold and expensive jewelry that I keep locked in my house could be taken because she left a damn window open or left my front door unlocked for 20 mins while she went to grab something to eat in between classes. Then last week I came home early and my freaken front door was OPEN. Literally about to have a heart attack but luckily no one actually came in. My sister left in a hurry to work and just…didn’t close the door completely or locked it when she left. I as extremely pissed and after that I took my key back from her. Now she’s not happy because she has to do her class outside on my porch and it feels humiliating to her and it’s really uncomfortable. 

My sister says she can’t even spend that much time on her assignments because her laptop loses battery and needs the outlet inside. My mind if made you because I’m just way too paranoid something else will happen but she thinks I’m being a huge asshole messing with her academics like this. I don’t know if I’m overthinking it or not by not letting her come back in when I’m not there. AITA?",231,1,ThrowRAsituation_

I realized I haven’t learned a thing, I just used my notes the entire time. It was open notes and I did well, but I know for a fact I would’ve done better if I was learning in person. 

I’ve realized how much our environment matters when learning. I could do homework and study at home, but I did much better and actually retained information when school was at school. There’s so many distractions at home. My phone, my family talking in the background, chores, etc. 

I also feel more compelled to go on my phone because I’m at home. For example, at work I don’t even feel the need to browse my phone because I’m at work, I have things to do and customers to check out.

4636,ghuzmp,2020-05-11 19:47:50,tifu,TIFU by masturbating during my online class,"This happened an hour or so ago. We’ve been having virtual class meetings in Zoom for a few weeks now and I’ve gotten used to it. I use my iPad which is really convenient as I can attend class anywhere. I usually just leave both my audio and camera off so I can do other things as class is very boring. Sometimes I take a quick nap, but today I was really in the mood and was in the middle of masturbating. I mean, all the assignments are posted elsewhere and the Zoom meetings are just for people to ask questions. I live alone in my apartment now that my roommate went to stay with her parents’ so I always have the house to myself. I was in a tank top and all I had underneath was a thong. I connect to the class and both my camera and audio was on so I turned them off. My audio was off, or so I thought. I was playing with my clit and I was moaning pretty loudly. Not 5 seconds passed before my professor went, “whoever is making those sounds you might want to turn your audio off.” I immediately froze and I went to check and I almost passed out when I found out my damn audio was still on. Aside from the professor, I was the only one who wasn’t muted, so anyone paying attention knew what I was doing. The rest of class was super awkward. My friends in the class texted me about it and had a good laugh at my expense. At least the class is once a week, I have a week left before I die of embarrassment next week. Looking on the bright side, at least my camera wasn’t on.

TL;DR I accidentally left my audio on during my online class while masturbating loudly, entire class heard it",144,18,azaleathebabe

My sleeping problems have only grown overtime and got exponentially larger during the pandemic. So yesterday it sort of came to a head while I was waiting for my next online college class to start.

I had been tired for a while and only got to sleep a couple hours the night before, so while I was waiting I laid down on the couch to take a nap. I fell asleep pretty quickly, but it didn’t last. My parents woke me up 15 minutes into the nap by talking too loudly as they ate. I was already annoyed by my lack of sleep and getting woken up pissed me off, so I told them to shut up in a voice just as loud as their voices were just a moment ago.

This set my dad off and he proceeded to yell at me because it was their house and they were eating, so they had a right to talk as much and as loud as they wanted. I argued back about common courtesy and how I was there first, so they should have tried to be quieter. The argument lasted until 15 minutes before my class, so I couldn’t go back to sleep anymore, and I stormed off to my desk, to wait for class to begin.

After class ended I went up to my room and stayed there until I decided to talk to my mom about it. My dad was downstairs so I thought we could discuss it peacefully and she would try to at least understand my side. It started off calm and I thought it was going well until she started arguing with me. She talked about how it was dinner time and how they should be able to talk at dinner time. She mentioned that I should’ve gone upstairs or dealt with it.

I proceeded to explain to her that I was merely asking for them to try and be quieter, not silent. I tried to explain that it was common courtesy and just would’ve been the kind thing for them to do.

She said that it was 2 against one and repeated that I could have gone upstairs. She said that I should have known that they were going to be loud and that I should’ve gone upstairs before I went to sleep.

As we continued to go back and forth the conversation veered away from the polite discussion it started at and became more heated. She continued to act like I wanted them to stop talking altogether even though I continued to explain that I just wanted them to be quiet. She never even touched on my point about common courtesy. Eventually I gave up.

I’ve had this discussion with my parents many times before, sometimes cool heads prevailed and more often than not we yelled at each other. In past discussions we’ve compromised or just made an agreement, but they always seem to forget or stop caring.

1591,lov9r1,2021-02-21 11:29:37,college,HELP: I feel like I'm forced to cheat online classes because I'm sick physically/mentally,"Hello everyone, please be kind I'm very sensitive at the moment.

I'm 20m

I already feel guilty and I know what I'm doing has long term consequences.

However, I feel sick. I experience pain every single day of my life for the last two years. When classes weren't online, I didn't cheat at all. I actually studied and got through the classes. But now that classes are online, I feel like it's just easier for me to cheat. It's a relief, it's one less worry. My classes/college compared to others, we need to teach ourselves and we have one meeting day for the week if we have any questions about the material. I usually learn from attending class and seeing powerpoints and just overall being in person. When I'm home I can't concentrate. I experience more emotional and physical pain when I'm home, because that's what I can ever think about. I'm trapped in my head. I can barely get out of bed sometimes. It's really a struggle.

When I see people criticize those who cheat, I'm already a minority struggling and my parents didn't pass me the typical generational wealth. So I'm really stuck of going to college and trying to pass to get a higher paying job, unless I want to work retail for the rest of my life. Like can anyone relate? Like I actually want to learn but I either will fail and mess up my financial aid or just not go to college at all and be stuck like my parents. It's a struggle. 

Any advice, I'm really struggling with this guilt.",87,1,jjhonest

And for some of my classmates that's inappropriate, I know that because one of my classmates (20's F) told me that it makes her feel uncomfortable, that what I do is not right and that I should stop doing that because it makes the whole class uncomfortable. But even when she told me that I didn't stop, because honestly I don't think I'm doing something wrong, I don't even show my boobs when I breastfeed my baby because I cover myself with a small towel. 

But yesterday, other classmates sent me a text telling me that I was being disrespectful to the whole class, and that I have to stop doing what I do if I want to continue in that class, and that made me feel so sad, because what's wrong with breastfeeding? It is something natural and shouldn't be something to be ashamed of, I talked to my partner (24M) and he supports me because he knows that our daughter is a new born and needs to be fed, so I want to know, AITA for breastfeeding my daughter in an online class even though my classmates said they are uncomfortable with it?",66,1,flo_123x

If we go on camera we have to be in school dress code, but I haven’t been going on camera so I was in my pajamas. The teacher said “MintGum, turn your camera on so we can see your face.” I went off mute and said I wasn’t in the dress code so she said to just show myself from the neck up.

She was recording the call for anyone who missed it and I really **didnt** wanna go on camera, so I kept it off. Eventually she said we can turn them off so everyone did.

Most people on here say they hate people and just want to be alone inside all day. That’s all fine and good but you have to realize that reddit is not real life. People need human and social interaction. People will be in dorms, parties, bars, etc. that’s just a fact. So what on gods green earth is the point of making us all do online classes because it’s “too dangerous to be in a classroom” when people are gathering in large groups anyways. If I wanted to attend the university of Phoenix, I would have. I am not paying a small fortune for zoom calls. I can’t defer or else I’ll lose my scholarship but I am showing up in person in class every day. 

All of it is just dumb. The argument for online classes makes sense in theory but it just doesn’t in practice 

BTW yes I believe that COVID exists. It is a serious illness and something that we should be taking seriously. However we are NOT a high risk group at all.  We have a MUCH higher chance of being murdered, car accident, etc than dyjng of COVID and honestly a point zero zero zero zero whatever chance of dying from it isn’t enough for me to give up a year of my childhood…sorry.

It's like zoom except you need a pass code and it's more private and secure (so I've been told). A few days ago, we had an online class. There was a few extra people with random names I hadn't heard of, cameras and volume were off. A friend (Joseph) messaged me and said he invited some friends to join in. I was tired and didn't think anything of it.

So the class goes on and all of a sudden people start freaking out. The ""friends"" had unmuted and were screaming racial slurs. They said they were hackers, they knew our location, we were in danger. My teacher just ended the entire class. A few minutes later a new link &amp; pass code were sent out. We rejoined, just the students. The teacher apologized and said that it appeared we were hacked, this should never have happened, he would launch a complaint with the system. Not everyone rejoined the class and in our group chat some people said they never wanted to do an online class again, they were so scared.

Joseph messaged me after and said he thought it was funny. I disagreed and said that he obviously scared people and he should fess up. He called me a pussy and we left it at that. I felt really bad, but didn't say anything.

Our online classes continued the next few days but that specific class was canceled. They sent out a mass email yesterday saying that they had launched an investigation into the situation in joint with the online class company because that never should have happened.  They said that they did not know what had happened but were looking into the possibility of someone from the school sharing the password and link. They said there would be serious consequences for anyone involved. A friend texted me after saying that she was scared. She has serious anxiety issues. She hadn't been in any online classes since because she was scared. I told her it would be okay but she did not believe me.

I messaged Joseph and said that he needed to fess up. He said I would be in trouble too, because I knew about it, but I honestly don't care. Its eating me up inside! He said he's already in trouble with the school and that he would probably get expelled for a stupid thing that didn't hurt anyone. I kind of agree, it's not like they came on screen naked or anything. But still! It was dangerous and stupid.  I told him either he needed to fess up or I would. I also reminded him that I have screenshots of our entire conversation so he couldn't pin it on me. He called me a dick and stopped responding.

Would I be the asshole if I sent our teacher the screenshots? I feel so bad for everyone who was scared by this, and they're putting a lot of effort into this investigation during this already troublesome time. Would I be the asshole if I snitched?

4183,hn4gj3,2020-07-07 22:18:50,college,It should be illegal for schools to force students to pay the same tuition for online classes as a replacement for in-person classes.,"Why? No dorm costs, no classroom costs, no gym costs, no outside activity costs, no security cost, no faculty that is only their for on-campus activities, no lab costs, no library costs, no power cost or plumbing cost, and professors essentially doing significantly less as they are not teaching in person rather making a single video for a whole class and posting all homework online. Everything about online classes is easier for the college and harder and much worse for the students. The professors can simply sit at their house stream or videotape a single video, and then that's it for the whole entire day (at least for the lecture aspect of it). While students have a lack of faculty, friends/community, outside activities, resources, connections, and the list goes on.

We all know this, online classes are way worse in quality, quantity, and overall are cheaper in the long run. It should be illegal for them to pay the same price, not only do they give us no choice (as it is almost impossible to transfer away from our school now) but they are also fucking with our future. At least lower the price to bring that to light. When we first applied to our college, we did not do it knowing that we will be fucked this year, and it would be all online, and the fact is we can't leave it without fucking our lives over, skipping a semester is not an option for the majority of people, and transferring is impossible, we have no other choice but to take these low-quality classes to stay on track yet the schools keep us in shackles and tell us to pay the same price for what was 1000000x times better than what we have now.",58,1,Skippers101

One of those is fishing. I love fishing and now I can literally go every morning. There's a lake close to where I live, Most mornings or evenings at 5 am/pm I go there, sometimes with my friends, we set up like 6 fishing rods either on our boat or near a fallen log, and cast our roads. Usually we go for catfish so we just cast and sit. I pay attention to class, take notes and participate whenever someone calls on me. 

I never felt bothered ot tell anyone what im doing, we don't have our video on unless a teacher specifically asks and we're talking or presenting. I've been doing this for a while, probably went fishing like 5-6 times during class until the incident on friday. 

It was 7 am, but 11 am in the timezone were my classes are held. Professor calls on me to explain something, at this point my friend had caught a fish and was reeling it in, then my friend yells ""I need your help now, we've got a big fucking fish here I can't handle this by myself get your ass over here now"" the professor asked what is going on and I told him I need to go and I'll be back in a minute, I immieadetely run over and I see what happened, he pulled in a massive catfish, no way he's going to be able to pull that in by himself. I jumped in the water (it was freezing) and I pulled it by the gills. 

I run back over to my phone and I profusely apologize. I told the professor we caught a massive catfish, he thought it was a joke and said he didn't believe me, so I turned the camera on and I showed it. He then said it was so rude and disrespectful for me to be fishing when I have online classes, and I explained to him that I've been doing this for a while and I never had an issue multitasking.  I finish doing what i need to do and class continues. 

He then sent me a message saying what I did is incredibly unprofessional and that he will be reporting this to the dean and that if I do this again I will be facing disciplinary action.

Actually di naman niya alam na nagpost ako nito haha pero I feel like we need suggestions coming from students themselves. Di rin naman ako prof pero gusto ko lang makatulong kahit papano. 

Nagtuturo naman siya dati pero F2F pa yun so iba ang struggles ng students ngayon. I want to know if you guys have any suggestions or you can even voice out some problems you encountered with the online set up. 

Ang balak for “chalk and talk” is gagamit ng iPad, bale magsusulat siya sa virtual blackboard with voice over, tapos i-uupload yun sa Youtube and may ibibigay na links sa class para ma-access siya (ako nagsuggest nito). Magbibigay din siya ng slides or notes as supplementary material, given naman na yun. 

Discord yung balak gamitin for the synch class which will be done once a week for any clarifications or questions na pwede i-raise ng students. Mas okay daw kasi Discord (data-wise) kaysa Zoom and Google Meet. Google classroom naman para organized yung sa submission ng reqs. Facebook group for important announcements ganern. 

Are we still missing something here? May suggestions pa ba regarding the set up na mas favorable sa students? Any better programs or apps we can use? Any problems he might encounter with the set up so we could address them? 

He will be teaching a GE and a major din. Petiks lang naman siya and very considerate so surebols na papasa mga students niya. Kaya mahal ko to eh char tres lang ako sa kaniya dati bobo kasi ako sa math huhu

4284,hbmg2b,2020-06-18 20:35:11,uAlberta,A look into full semester online classes (rant),"Hello all: I am currently taking 5 summer courses (engineering) and I thought some of you would like to know the effect of having letter graded online classes. 

The entire semester has been a train wreck. 

1. All exams are open book, which may sound like a good thing until you realize time constraints still exist and are actually tighter than normal to compensate. For submitting exams there are two possibilities:

A) For many courses, all written work must be submitted (via .pdf) within time limits, so if your computer, your email, scanner or phone don’t work instantly you are outta luck and have to had your potential cheating recorded. 

B) The other option is actually worse. Some professors bypass the submission of written work entirely and condense 15 mark application questions into two or three written responses that are automarked. So if you truncated data a couple of times and are outside the 0.5% threshold at the start, you get 0 for a question worth 25% of the exam. 

This isn’t even to mention the absolutely flagrant cheating that is occurring in many classes. Not every class is supposed to have an average in the 80s in Engg.

2. If you are like me and don’t have tons of friends you know beforehand in your classes, good luck doing assignments in any collaborative fashion. Meeting people in classes is basically impossible because all classes are zoom based meaning all chat has to go through the central forum and can be viewed by the prof and every other student, making personal or specific conversations impossible even at breaks or when given time to solve in class problems. 

3. The privilege of having global chat at all can be rescinded at any time when one student in the class decides it’s funny to change their name on Zoom and sexually harass the prof.

4. Help on assignments and seminars is such a mixed bag and sucks for both profs and students. Some profs are somehow expected to take huge numbers of hours to respond to student inquiries, which are drastically up since peer to peer collaboration has decreased. Also have any of you actually tried to proof an assignment question over video chat? It’s a complete nightmare for the prof and wastes dozens of hours of their time, hours which probably don’t get compensated. Other profs have clearly used this pandemic as an excuse to be even more inaccessible. Asking questions after class is often impossible and if you can’t make their office hours, good luck.

5. Assignment renders: this deserves its own point. When you are inevitably rushing to upload an assignment or exam .pdf often the document doesn’t render properly. Because the deadline has passed, TAs usually can’t ask for resubmissions for marking purposes, regardless of how completely illegible the work is if the assignment didn’t render properly or your TapScanner wasn’t lit properly. I’m not a TA but I’ve already had assignments that looking back I would have gotten annoyed with as a marker.

6. Lecture timing: An incredibly under-appreciated part of uni is that between classes is that you walk from class to class. Or in other words. You get to take 10 mins between each class and get physical exercise for every hour of content. As there is no distance to walk between your computer and itself, profs can get away with teaching the entire 60 or 90 minute block. This may not seem like a big deal but it means with my schedule that occasionally, I sit at my desk without getting up for 6 or more hours straight.

7. Textbooks: the Bookstore has done an excellent job ensuring textbooks are shipped out on time but the current COVID pandemic has massively overloaded the standard mailing system to the point where you can’t buy books in store and mailing takes up to two weeks. I didn’t have multiple required textbooks until the end of May after ordering them week 1.

8. All of this implies you get a professor that is relatively organized and can at least lecture competently. If you get a prof who would be disorganized in a normal semester, you get a complete nightmare. I’m currently on the brink of withdrawing from a non-core Engineering class because the professor is so disorganized the class lacks the basic resources to actually solve the assignments. I can’t get the textbook due to sellouts and even if I did it won’t get here until Finals. Assignment feedback and solutions are just not posted for review. In class handouts are just not being given or substituted. 

9. The mental toll on students: This pandemic has been hell for everyone. People have lost ungodly sums of income, students who rely on living outside of their parents homes for a productive work environment have been forced to move back home, the hobbies we use to destress are often gone or restricted, letting steam off on the weekends just doesn’t happen. Students often go weeks without leaving the house save for a walk around the block, a brief respite from a world now dominated by endless homework, Netflix and porn.

I say all this not to pointlessly yell into the reddit abyss about my very minor problems in the context of a global pandemic. I say this because those of you going for online classes this Fall need to know what you are in for, what it’s like to have 3.5 months of classes and graded exams in the midst of all this chaos. 

Tons of people are working hard with the resources they have to make our education experience as tolerable as possible but the fundamental constraints online classes impose has caused a substantial reduction in the quality of the overall education experience. If you are debating taking classes this Fall or taking a gap year, this is what you are comparing a gap year to.

I figured that this could be a good time to get some sleep for my period 2 class, which I had that test in. 

After setting my alarm for the next period, five minutes into my nice nap, my mom barges into my room asking me why I'm not up in my first period class. I tell her I'm signed on to it and that we're just watching a movie. She starts to get furious at me, demanding me to get on and listen to my class. I tell her that the class is easy and that I'd probably be better off getting sleep for my next class. She ignores my reason, continuing to demand me to get up and pay attention. 

I feel that my mom has always overly-monitored me when it comes to school, not giving me any privacy. She's always scoping out my gradebook like a hawk for one bad grade so she can yell at me about it. I get if she was doing this throughout my middle school years, and maybe a little of my beginning high school career, but in my senior year, at 17 years old, she still constantly needs to make sure I'm this perfect student. I can't catch a break on anything. Another thing that ruins my privacy is that my room is directly connected to hers. My room is directly connected to the stairs which means that when she goes downstairs or comes back upstairs, she has to go through my room and she gets to check whatever I'm doing. 

I just feel that being in my senior year in high school, I can skip a first period forensic science class or two (without even being marked absent because I'm signed on) without having to worry about my mom's outbursts at me.",53,1,throwawayshit_
4222,hiyzfs,2020-06-30 23:36:37,AmItheAsshole,AITA for being mean to a girl in online classes?,"Throwaway.

So this happened in online classes and i think I’m in the right here. So earlier today we had an online lecture, it was very boring though. So I made some fun and started blasting some random music through the mic. Teacher told me to me to stop but this girl got triggered. She raged at me to stop and I thought to myself that it was rude.

So he was talking about some random science stuff (idk) and I decided to leave because I was very bored. Well apparently some this girl from before snitched on me and told the teacher i dipped. 

Got an email to return and I came back. So I’m mad at the kid who snitched (call her rose), so I told her in pms to watch her mouth. Kid snitched again. This time my teacher didn’t care so I was free.

Some context on rose: very smart, always volunteers and is always getting straight A’s.

So when rose started answering questions out loud I decided to interrupt her because she wouldn’t mind her damn business. Convo went like this:

R: mr __ is the mito-

Me: can I use the washroom?

So yeah I annoyed her a lot. You see I know it’s bad I skip class but why should rose care? This is why I’m mad. Reddit AITA",53,1,yrotsekaf
1682,lhf028,2021-02-11 06:48:58,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not taking down a celebrity cardboard standee during online classes? It's not even mine.,"My older brother has this cardboard standee of his celebrity crush with a photoshopped beer bucket.  His friends gave it to him at the finish line of his first marathon, and it's some kind of in-joke between them.  Since he's in the Navy now, he obviously couldn't bring the standee with him.  So now it (let's call it Emma since that's the name of his crush) lives in our room.  I like having Emma around since it reminds me of my bro and I miss him.

Since you can only see the standee's head and chest, not the beer bucket, from my zoom feed, I thought nothing of it.  It's a conversation starter since some of my classmates are a fan of her, nothing more.  

Since the start of the semester, a couple of girls in one of my classes have been telling me over chat that I had to get rid of Emma.  They're friends with this girl who has a crush on me.  I've had to let the girl down a couple of times, but I guess she's still hung up on me.  According to them, seeing the standee upsets her and is ruining her self esteem since now she thinks I'm attracted to girls who look like Emma (I'm not, but I'm not attracted to my classmate either).  

If they had asked if I remove Emma from my view feed, it would be fine.They told me that she had to go in the trash and prove it to the girl as an apology for hurting her.  They want me to shred the stupid cutout.  And I'm not doing that.  My bro won't be back from deployment for a long time but he would be pissed if he found out I got rid of  his cutout.  I tried to explain to them that it's my brother's, but apparently its not good enough.  They want me to prove my loyalty to their friend by burning it or something like that.

I feel sorry for the girl, I really do, but getting rid of or destroying a cutout of a celebrity I don't even like isn't going to help anyone.  And I feel like if I did, this would just be an excuse for my classmate to act out again in the future.  

My friends are sticking up for me, but one or two says that I should just keep Emma out of view.  I agree now, but the girls are still pissed that I won't burn down a stupid piece of cardboard.  And now they're badmouthing me to the rest of our grade.

TL;DR: AITA for refusing to destroy a cardboard standee of a celebrity a girl in my class feels threatened by.  Especially when it's not even mine?  I can't believe I have to write a post about this but it's making me go crazy.",52,1,cardboardstand_aita
2170,krsv07,2021-01-06 17:43:10,tifu,TIFU by wathcing porn during online class and not muting the mic,"Before you say anything: no, my camera wasn't turned on.

We've been in lockdown since early November here in Hungary, and this was just another usual day, sitting through online classes, trying my best not to daydream. However, this was during German class, which I usually don't pay too much attention to, since I spend a lot of time with my extended family in Vienna, Austria, so I know a decent amount of German. But in spite of all this, the teacher sometimes still calls on me, when no one else can answer the question.

After answering one of these questions, I had the quite questionable idea to watch some porn, but I went along with this hell of an idea nonetheless. Now, I was logged in to class on my PC, but was watching porn on my phone, but I put the phone right in front of my laptop, and there was no headset plugged into the laptop, so everything happening around me can usually be heard.

After a good 5 minutes into the video, one guy let out a rather **audible** moan, which was so loud, that I'm pretty sure even my brother could hear it in the room next to mine. I quickly lowered the volume, but when I took a quick glance at my laptop screen, I noticed that after answering the question, I forgot to turn off my mic. That, combined with the sudden influx of Messenger notifications on my phone, quickly led me to the realisation:

# They heard the moan!

With shaking hands, I opened the group chat, and like 6-7 people were simultaniously asking ""did y'all hear the moan"" ""what was that moan"" and other questions like this. Scared and scarred, I typed ""tf was that"" into the group chat, muted my mic and starred at the laptop until the end of the class, questioning my life decisions. No one actually said anything during the online class, so I don't know exactly how many people have heard it, or if the teacher could hear it, but that was a uniquely interesting experience.

TL;DR.: I watched porn during online class without muting my mic and they heard the moaning.",52,3,LifeIsNotMyFavourite
425,qdj6hf,2021-10-22 15:20:07,peyups,[UPD] I want online classes to stay as an option.,"Madami akong nakikita dito na mas prefer ang ftf classes and 'pag sinabi kong bangag na ako sa mga class discords, ang unang i-aassume ng mga classmates ko is nakakapagod daw talaga 'pag online classes.

Sa tingin ko though, mas nakakapagod ang ftf classes. Why? (Personally lang ah. Medyo mahaba 'to haha. Basahin mo lang if gusto mo makabasa ng POV ng iba. I'm not telling anyone to agree with me or nah. You do you.)

Mas mura
- Mahirap lang kami at marami kaming magkakapatid. Taga NCR lang kami pero malayo parin sa diliman and hindi per capita ang basehan sa ITR ng magulang namin kaya hindi kami prio kapag kukuha ng student dorms, and so never akong nakakuha ng dorm. Ang pinakamurang bedspace na makukuha malapit sa diliman is 2k/month (cheapest of the cheap na yan). With utilities na yan. Natry ko na mag-commute. 1.5+ hrs one way is not fun. If online classes hindi ko na kailangang pumila sa sakayan or makipag-agawan sa jeep.
- Ang usual na price ng isang gulay meal sa mga in campus canteen ay around 100 with extra rice. Kapag may karne 150+. So kung kakain ako ng dalawang beses sa isang araw, gagastos ako ng 6k/month. Kulang kulang na yan sakin, araw araw akong nagugutom parin. Hindi ko alam bakit mas mura pa ang jollibee burger steak kaysa sa canteen food.
- Imagine, galing  ako CHK tas next subject ko is sa NIP tapos after non CAS. 7 pesos ang jeep dati per ride. If sasakay ako ng jeep dalawang beses sa isang araw and TWThF lang ako, gagastos ako ng 224/month.
- School supplies. Sabihin na nating 76 per month, lahat na ng ballpen and bluebook kasama diyan so mura na yan.
- Laundry expenses. 200 wash and dry na every two weeks so 400/month. Hindi naman nalilinis ng gaano ang damit dito. Nag-aamoy sabon lang pero mukhang madumi padin haha.

- So, 8.7k per month ang gastos. For me na DOST scholar na ang kaya lang ay 8k per month, kulang na agad ng 700. Wala pa diyan ang menstruation pads and gamot. Wala din yung pangbili ng data kasi hindi sakop ng uni wifi yung tinitirhan ko non. Mapapa-pancit canton nalang ako. It doesn't help na sa bandang patapos pa ng sem nagpaparamdam si DOST stipend.

- If online classes, may initial investment na 30k sa computer (ok na ang specs niyan, pwede na rin panglaro), tapos siguro dagdag na 1k per month sa kuryente (sobrang taas na niyan). So 35k ang gastos sa initial sem tapos 5k nalang mga susunod. Yung sobra sa stipend mabibigay sa family pang-groceries.

Mas healthy (in a way?)
- I get really bad periods. Yung tipong nakakahimatay and bedridden ako buong magdamag sa 1st/2nd day. Attending a traditional class in this state is very hard if not impossible; hindi rin maiiwasan yung mga big classes and classes na airconditioned (cold temperature + period = bad). Getting up from my bed and climbing up my chair para makaattend ng online classes? Doable. Hindi ko na rin kailangang magpanggap na masaya ako sa mga prof na nakakagigil. The same applies if sinisinat ako/I have any other medical issue.
- Nasa bahay kaya lutong bahay rin pagkain. 
- Hindi ko alam kung ako lang ba yung ganto pero madalas akong madehydrate (and so I often get UTI) sa ftf classes. Naglalakad lang kasi ako imbis na magjeep kahit malayo. Attending classes with UTI is not fun.

Less conscious ka sa maraming bagay bagay
- Sa damit. Kung wala kang pambili ng matinong damit or sapatos, nakaka-conscious lalo na na majority ng mga kaklase mo ay may kaya. Ngayon kahit wala na kong suot na shorts or bra ok lang.
- Hindi ko na kailangang mang-reject sa mga gala sa katip or SM North while knowing na I'm dirt poor. 
- Hindi ko na kailangang maligo gamit ang ice water tuwing madaling araw. Actually, kahit wag na ko maligo, okay lang. Not that I do that though hehe.

Mas tipid sa oras
- Napaka flexible ng oras ko ngayong online classes. Pwede akog maghugas ng pinggan in between subjects or in between doing my assignments if need ng mata ko ng break from the computer. Pwede akong magbabad ng damit before my first subject tapos salang sa washing machine after my first subject. Pwede akong magtiklop ng damit habang nasa online class.
- Hindi ko na kailangang pumunta sa sa UHS if need ng medcert if hindi ako naka-attend ng classes.
- Wala nang lakad lakad from NIP to CAS. Wala nang commute commute if wala kang dorm.
- Hindi sayang oras ko 'pag may prof na biglang nag-cancel ng class. Imagine galing ka ng NIP tas makikita mo nalang naka-tape sa pinto ng class mo sa CAS ""no classes today! -Mrs. Prof"".

Wala akong masyadong masabi pagdating sa studies kasi sanay na ko sa self-study. Kahit ftf rin naman I will still have to self-study. Mas marami nga lang akong time mag-aral ngayon gawa ng online classes. Basta you know how to navigate the net well, maraming study resources sa net (looking at you, mga Indian na andaming helpful videos sa math and programming). Con na nga lang na hindi mo alam if may nandadaya ba na iba tapos they get higher grades than you. Hindi ako competitive towards others so hindi ako masyadong affected nito. Basta nakikita kong nag-iimprove ako, content na ko.

Mas may nakakasalamuha pa akong friends right now kasi pwedeng tambay tambay lang sa discord ng tropa 'pag free time. 

I get sad knowing na if ever ibalik ang ftf for all, mag-strustruggle nanaman ako na walang makain minsan kasi hindi namin afford, the pandemic aside.

May iba rin bang mas gusto ang online classes dito or super minority lang ako?

The cramps got very severe and the online tutor had to be cancelled (it was reschedule and my parents didn’t pay for it) and I feel REALLY bad about it, so when I finished in the bathroom I went straight upstairs to my room. It didn’t even cross my mind to say sorry to my dad about missing the tutor, he came upstairs and said I let him down and I asked him why, he ignored me and then slammed my door and It really upset. So I’ve been ignoring him…I know I should be the grown up (I’m 16) but he’s acting like I did it on purpose!

My mum came up and said I should apologise because I should of came down earlier, she also said I should of apologised to him about missing it. now my mum hasn’t has a period in over 20 years? Today my mum came into my room and said I was being a teenager and I should go say sorry, I said that isn’t helping and I’m not saying sorry. She got in my face and said, “REALLY?”

I just think I shouldn’t say sorry for something that’s out of my control, I didn’t do it on purpose and I hardly miss my online lessons and I think I shouldn’t be treated so coldly by him for this. My mum hasn’t had a period in years and I think she’s forgotten that I can’t control when the cramps comes and other shit

Even though they do have one synchronous session a week, it is voluntary so I'm not sure how many people will actually attend.

To address this, I'm considering mandatory one-on-one sessions with each student a couple of times during the semester. As part of their attendance grade I'm going to require each student to schedule a one-on-one zoom meeting anywhere from say 5 to 15 minutes where I can just check in with them see how they're doing, ask what difficulties they're having, and things of that nature

I'm curious if anyone has tried this and what their opinion is.

1056,ngste0,2021-05-20 06:29:51,AmItheAsshole,AITA for suggesting that my roommate use her room for online classes,"Okay, so I live with two other girls in a one bedroom apartment. My two roommates share a room together, and I have my own separate living space in a section of the living room. 

All of us are students and take online classes because of covid. 
One of my roommates is barely at home, so my other roommate basically has the entire room to herself most of the time. She’s a dental student, so her classes are pretty intense and last for hours. 

So, yesterday, she was in a 5h zoom class and sitting in the living room which is connected to my “room”. A friend called, so I left the sofa to go sit on my bed in my separate living space, so I wouldn’t disturb her. It’s not a big apartment so there’s not really any other place I can go to. Anyway, so she got annoyed at me and asked me to lower my voice, while talking on the phone, which I did.

Later on, I suggested that she could also just use her bedroom for her online class, if she wants complete silence since the room wasn’t being used at the moment. I explained to her that it’s kinda hard for me to go to any other room since my “room” is in the living room where she was. This pissed her off and she held a grudge over it for over 24h. 

Fast forward, and she’s now decided to move out, which means that me and the other girl also have to move out because a the only one on the official lease. She’s yelled at me about the whole incident and called me selfish for suggesting that she could use her bedroom instead of the living room to have complete silence. She based her anger off of a false claim that I had told her that I didn’t want to lower my voice. I never told her that. I tried to explain that I meant no harm and that I just meant that she could always use her room since she has a whole bedroom instead of using the living room where she knows I live and telling me how to be in my own room. She said she wanted to do the zoom class in the living room cause she didn’t want her class to see how messy her room is so I even offered to help her clean her room, but that wasn’t enough. I just wish she would’ve just talked to me instead of canceling the lease behind our backs and then yelling at me and making false claims instead of just trying to solve this. It’s a very fixable issue in my opinion. Am I the asshole here?",48,1,thinwhiteduke76

I don’t live one the US, so these online lessons will end soon

Somehow my laptop’s camera broke during quarantine, and with online lessons required to show your face, I will need a functioning camera for lesson. 

During these online lessons, most teachers don’t care if you have a camera or not. Except for one, she always force us to do thing we don’t like as in students. She’s kind of a bitch but no one dares to criticise her. 

Fast forward to today, I didn’t answer a question correctly and she said that either I fix my laptop or buy a new camera. I don’t have the money for either options. But since that online lessons will be ending soon, why waste money on stuff that I’ll probably never use again. So I won’t be having the money for that even though I agree with them. 

WIBTA for not buying a camera?

School does provide tablets for online lessons but I thought if I have what I needed to learn well, why would i borrow one. And I’m always paranoid about borrowing others’ stuff, like I’ll break it or something.

He specified that it’s an interactive class and I need to have my camera and audio turned on but as far as I can remember, this wasn’t specified in the description when I was signing up. I had my mic turned on though and I did talk and engage with everyone. When I signed up, I don’t remember it saying anything about switching my camera on, and if that was the case I probably wouldn’t have signed up in the first place.

2307,kfd93b,2020-12-18 03:37:21,Professors,Are other universities also diminishing teaching contributions for online classes?,"Sorry for the confusing title

&amp;#x200B;

I just got my proposed teaching schedule for next year and I was shocked

&amp;#x200B;

I taught 4 sections of the same class digitally last semester, which lead to a 6 hour teaching load (1.5 X 4). The department asked me to record and upload lecture videos and have Q&amp;A sessions so that's what I did.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, the department is saying that even though I will be teaching 4 sections of the same class digitally next semester, that will be counted as teaching 1 section, because I am basically using the same recorded video for the other 3 sections (FYI I will not be recycling the recording I made last semester. I will be recording them all new again). They are saying this is equivalent to a 1.5 hours teaching load. 

&amp;#x200B;

Using this logic, they are asking me to teach the same 4 sections for next semester, the summer semester, and the semester after that (totalling to 4.5 hours teaching load)

&amp;#x200B;

I was utterly shocked and am thinking about contesting this, but I wanted to ask other people here if this is something a lot of universities are doing given the pandemic situation.",43,3,OffProff

I’ve been designing all the materials for my class to be viewed on a computer, from PDFs to Videos to lectures...but I am starting to wonder if I need to explicitly state from the beginning that students need to use computers. However, some of my students may not have computers or reliable internet access, or just prefer their phones because they are newer/better. 

How are you all approaching this for designing coursework? Would this be something to say from the beginning (maybe not that it’s mandatory, but that it is highly suggested)?

2272,ki8vpw,2020-12-22 16:43:44,Professors,Cheating in online classes,"There is a consensus in our department that cheating in the form of copying and collusion is rampant among our students, in homework and in take-home exams.

We know this because whenever we ask students for feedback, there are many complaints from students who say they don't cheat but many others do, and they feel it's unfair that their academic honesty puts them at a disadvantage.  I also see this come up in most of my course evaluations.  In some cases where evidence of cheating was very clear, I have referred students to the university's Student Conduct office.  

The issue has been ongoing for years, but now exacerbated by the online learning format.  
Before the pandemic, the way I've addressed the problem is by giving the most weight to in-class exams and making up new exams every semester.  Unfortunately I can't do this anymore.  Online proctoring services are problematic in multiple ways, and not allowed at my school anyway.  
Project-based learning has been suggested as a good type of assignment for online courses.  I do have the students prepare papers and presentations.  But this doesn't assess their understanding of the core material the way that an exam does.  Some of the evaluations from the spring even mentioned this issue, saying that not having exams meant that they basically stopped studying after the online transition.  I'd like to find a way to assess learning in a more rigorous way.   
 I am thinking of giving individual oral exams.  I have just enough TA support that twice a semester we could give 10-minute oral exams to each student, drawing randomly from a large bank of problems.  I've never done anything like this, so I don't know how students would respond.    
Any suggestions?  I'm in the US if that matters.",42,1,parrotlunaire

1647,lj22hl,2021-02-13 15:02:12,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling a child not to do something on our online class page?,"So I’m a grade 5 teacher who has been teaching online since November. This is my first teaching job and as I’m on a temporary contract with the school, I’ve been following exactly what admin of the school have advised to do.

When we first started, we thought it was temporary. And so lessons were “teach them through the screen and hope they do the work”. But in those first couple of weeks, we definitely improved the online set up and made it more engaging for the students. One of the first things we did was lift the conversation restriction. And started activities outside curriculum to help boost morale.

The first activity we did was creating a nature mural (go for a walk, collect things, make a mural using what you find). Then they shared pictures of it online. But then a kid shared a picture of another random drawing to which I said that it was nice but they have to only share things on-topic.

But then the principal decided to allow students to share anything they wanted (within reason). At the time, the only thing I had off-topic was the drawing. I hadn’t deleted it, but I deleted my comment. Then I spoke to the whole class to let them know that we changed the rules and it’s okay to share other things. I thought this girl understood that as she was sharing drawings, food, a picture of her X-ray (which was weird but whatever I allowed it), etc.

Then recently she shared a video from her TikTok and told her friends to like/follow her. I deleted this and definitely was not eloquent or explained well as I should have because I said “we do not share videos like this”. It’s school policy because social media.

Now her mom is upset with me. As this was the second time I told her daughter not to do something, she feels that I have a very toxic classroom. She said her daughter has been suffering mentally because of these things I’ve done and that I’ve been showing favoritism towards other students. Because of the way she said things, the school counselor has recommended therapy and the mom is not having it. She said the issue is me.

I’m struggling with this morally. Everyone I know tells me that the mom is crazy but I’m fairly sure that I’m in the wrong. This is my first teaching job and I have no idea if I was being too firm and over-disciplining and policing what they post online. I’ve been trying so hard to do right with what the admin might expect from me that I think I’ve forgotten how I’m impacting these kids mentally.

No other parent has complained but she says that other kids must feel the same but their parents aren’t privy to the situation to notice or speak.

(Another issue - when I’ve deleted the comments a child made then whats left is me saying their name and telling them off. So in full stupidity, I was deleting my comments once I saw they had read them. My reasoning was that other kids wouldn’t see and judge, and that being called out wouldn’t be left there like a negative reminder. But now I think this is gonna come back and bite me in the ass).

That means that every school, especially in the Greater Sydney region is doing online learning, a shitty attempt at teaching students the same shit they did before Corona.

Today, during Chinese, we did a speaking exercise and I randomly checked my phone. I ended up scrolling through a few NSFW posts on twitter but thought nothing of it. A minute later, I got extremely horny. I've been horny before, but it felt like I HAD to masturbate. There was no stopping me. I ended up just busting a nut dry while class was still going on, and I had a moment of shame, as busting a nut during class was a new absolute low for me. However, I had a moment of clarity because I thought: ""At least I had my mic muted.""... ***or so I fucking thought***. From the best of my memory I kept really quiet while I busted, only letting the sounds of my fabric hoodie rustling and a few low breaths escape my silence. But still, I am anxious that someone heard me, and that my peers will never let this down for as long as I am alive.

552,psdn06,2021-09-21 07:07:45,tifu,TIFU by not attending online class and playing with my phone which resulted in losing my scholarship.,"For some background I'm not from America so our School system is different from most of the people in reddit(it's more rigid and very competitive/trash) and I'll say sorry in advance for any wrong grammar, English is not my first language and I'm on mobile.


TL;DR: I'm too much dependent with my phone that i fail my class and lost my hard worn scholarship. So i need to start again to get the University Scholarship.


I'm(16f) currently in my 12th Grade in High School so in a few months I'll be heading to college, so this is the last year i will get my scholarship allowance but i freak it up. In our place scholarship isn't just a matter of money but it was also viewed as a matter of honor. Why wouldn't it be, among more than fifteen thousand grade sixth students only a handful of students is eligible to become one every year. In our city it was a very big deal for every graduating elementary students. Schools fight to have one spot for their students because the scholarship will also grant students a free pass to our city's science high, less strict process for university scholarship and of course your parents can brag to other parents and school can make a banner for you to brag to other schools.

After numerous process I'm lucky enough to pass. So I'm a city scholar since 7th grade and my mom terribly values it. The problem is that my dad died and then c-19 came and I'm stuck at our house. Grief, anxiety, fear and boredom damages one thing- my mental health. I then regularly sleep late(use to sleep at 8-9 but now 12-2), I no longer brush my hair, I never my bed, and I keep wishing that my life will end or i want to end my life. I also skip my online classes(11) cause i feel overwhelmed with unfamiliar classmates and teacher that I can't speak or show my face in camera. In return i got addicted to my phone that I can't put it down and it became the reason why i wake up everyday. 

My grades took a toll, i used to be a honor student with an average of 97 but now I'm a irregular student with an average of 80 and a back subject in world religion. I get removed from the scholarship program because the lowest they can go is 85. I can feel the regret of the head of the scholarship program across screen when i reported my average. We are quite close cause she used to teach in my elem school. My mom is highly infuriated that she can no longer brag to other parents and now felling that we are lower than an average household in our city. But she saw signs that it will happen and 1650(in our money but less than $50 for Americans) is not a big deal to lose, so she just kinda ok with it now as long as i don't screw my 12th grade. I don't regret it that much though, i guess i real what i sow. Actions bite back and now I'm back to zero. I'll just gonna try hard again this year to get an average of 98 so i can .ake sure that i will get the university scholarship, it's a bit hard but I'll make sure I will do it properly this time. Thanks for reading my vent on how i screw my scholarship, goodbye and i hope you will have a nice day a head of you.",36,1,LemonandeSugar

4446,gs1c9u,2020-05-28 07:03:17,tifu,TIFU by abusing my professor in online class,"So another day in lockdown. I am attending online class in Zoom. Normally everyone except the professor turns off his/her camera and audio so as to do whatever we want. Often to ensure that students are paying attention to the class, the  professor randomly calls out any name and asks a question on what he just discussed. Yesterday, I was on my phone, thrashing the teacher in a whatsapp group when i heard my name called out.  I quickly unmuted myself and asked him to repeat the question. The question was an easy question but i couldn't answer because i never pay attention to online classes. Dont know why, the professor grew really angry and started  shouting at me to which i apologized politely and thus he passed the question to someone else. Just after that I recieved a phone call from my friend and we started cursing the teacher. I abused him really bad and then noticed that the professor had stopped talking in the class. I looked at my mic status which wasn't on mute and I realised  that I was totally screwed. I quickly muted myself but the ship had sailed by then. The worst part is that the host, professors and the students record the classes and thus it can be reproduced very easily.
‌i have written an apology letter to the professor and the students but i know that I'm really fucked up. The course has 6 credits and i know it's going to affect my  grades.

For one, my regular commute takes nearly an hour and a half both ways on the awful Translink buses, which means now I can wake up later and don't have to worry about the bus getting delayed or worse, it already being full. It also saves me three hours each school day. I can't be the only person who appreciates not having to commute to school, right?

Also, I now don't have to worry about finding a charger for my laptop in the lecture hall, or running across campus in ten minutes, and I actually really like the fact that most of my lectures have TAs answering questions in real time in the chat. I also find that I'm no more unlikely to pay attention in class than I am in a Zoom room. The only thing I hate is that UBC uses Zoom, which has a terrible privacy and security record.

Some of them are pushing to cancel classes altogether, squandering the opportunity to learn despite the challenges presented by the pandemic.

I just don't understand the reasoning.""

And the main reason I was presented with that I didn't accept to be reasonable, is that students don't want to leave behind their friends, or that it's incredibly stressful to work in this pandemic.

I live in a developing country, and many people don't have a steady access to the internet. So it's understandable that not everyone can participate in a teleconference class.

However, I find it utterly stupid or hypocritical or idealistic, to want to end classes altogether even if you have the means.

I said to them, if you are a kid with a gaming computer, don't pretend that you want classes to end for the sake of your friends, because chances are you just want to play without the guilt.

Another thing I said is try for them to apply their logic to work from home adults. Should we stop all semblance of industry because many of our countrymen are too poor to own a computer?

that's what I thought...

I opened WhatsApp (as it's the only thing me and my whole class can chat on) and I see a picture of me during online class and they are making fun of me, I get mad and tell them I will report them to the school as soon as I get better. (I was feeling sick and I am now fine)

The second day during online class I get asked to open my camera but I refuse.

The teacher asks me why and I tell her that the last time I opened my camera some people took pictures of me and made fun of me.

the teacher asks who and I tell her who did it and they were both not even concentrating to online class and they were playing video games.

as soon as they get kicked out of the meeting they got as mad as a bull that just got spanked on the butt.

they said "" are you kidding me?? we were just joking!!!""

"" I don't like that type of jokes plus you guys took pictures of me without me knowing"" I said.

as soon as I said that jerk 3 got really mad, "" WE DID THIS TO EVERYONE ELSE AND U R THE ONE THAT RUINED ALL THE FUN""

me: ""oh so you guys did it to the whole class... ok that's an even bigger reason why you guys should be expelled""

jerk 1: ""fr dude (fr means for real) we were just joking around""

me: ""oh if i am wrong then why did the teacher kicked u out of online class? they thought it was wrong so they kicked you""

jerk 2: ""u know what nobody will ever talk to u again and you won't have friends and u will come begging us to be friends again""

me: ""I have friends and i don't need you guys so fk off, never text me, call me or even look at me if i saw u at the street""

3652,imy2ro,2020-09-05 09:08:44,teenagers,Teacher post (sorry). What is something your teachers do for online class that you actually like?,"We're starting the school year online. I'm thankful because I really don't want to risk getting covid, but also worried. Last spring was a mess. Hardly any kids even came to class, the ones who did wouldn't turn their cameras on or respond to any questions (even just a ""How was your weekend?""). I know for sure a lot of them just logged on and went off to do something else, because when class would end I would leave the room open for the one or two kids who needed to ask a question. And there'd be like five other kids still signed in, even though I told them they were free to go. The few times anyone did speak, they were just screaming, cussing me out, or mooning the class. 

This year will be a little better, I hope. We can actually give grades now, so they'll at least have that to motivate them. But we can't require them to turn on their cameras, and we can't deduct points if they don't come to class or don't participate. 

I don't mind them having the cameras off that much if they're still talking to me and participating, but it's so discouraging when I'm just talking to a screen full of silent black boxes. I feel like a fool. Just sitting there, talking to myself, no idea if anyone is there, or if the people on the other end are even my students. Or even children at all. For all I know, it's just a room full of weirdo creeps who got a hold of my zoom link and thought it would be fun to watch me teach social studies to preteens. 


So, I'm wondering, what are some things your teachers have done in zoom classes that you actually liked? Is there anything that might motivate you to participate in the class? I've seen hundreds of posts about what kids hated, but very little about what they actually do want to see. 


My powers are limited. I have no money for bribes to students or to administrators, and I cannot cure covid. But I am at least a little clever with technology, and motivated enough to look up a tutorial if I don't know how to do something. And my administration has given their blessing for us to do more ""fun"" stuff in class, as long as there's also learning happening too. 

Any ideas? Please help, I really want my kids to at least get *something* good out of this year.",28,1,TalkToPlantsNotCops

4683,gfuuud,2020-05-08 15:07:25,AmItheAsshole,AITA for wanting to have online class in my room instead of downstairs where my parents can see me?,"I (15M with ADD) am in 9th grade and I'm admittedly not doing too well in school right now. One day I had a math test, which went fine for the first half. Then I kind of forgot about it and zoned out for pretty much the entire second half of class. I felt really bad and I couldn't concentrate at all when I had my chemistry tutor next period. The same feeling of panic and zero productivity carried into chemistry class, which is why I decided to just straight up leave halfway through. I texted my friends about it, and I assume they told my teachers.

That night I told my parents about my troubles. They felt bad for me and comforted me. The next day, my mom told me I should have class downstairs because she was disinfecting my room just to be safe, which makes sense because I recently had a cough, and we never did confirm that it wasn't *that* virus. So I did all my classes downstairs. But it turns out my mom wants me to have class downstairs where she can see me, because she thinks it's better than if I had class upstairs. I think it makes no difference, because during chemistry downstairs I was very zoned out and clueless either way.

Then my mom tried bribing me and said she'd buy LEGOs  for me each week if I had class downstairs, because I'm a collector of LEGOs.  I didn't accept her bribe, it felt stupid and wrong and I don't think parents should be bribing their kids like that. But when the carrot didn't work, my parents tried the stick. They both came up to my room and said that  they'd take away my phone and video games if I don't have class downstairs. They also said they'd take away my door. This made me really mad. I think privacy is a right, not a privilege, and the way I see it, they're straight up threatening me if I don't do what they want.

We were having this argument while they were standing at my door, just barely standing in my room. I told them to step two feet back so I could lock the door and end this argument. Then my dad told me that none of the locks in the house are real, they're just these twisty knob locks that can be bypassed with a toothpick. That's right, my parents *do* have a secret weapon for getting into me and my brother's rooms, and they never tell us what it is. I got even angrier when I remembered that and started demanding that a real lock be installed in my room. Luckily, the argument ended because I had to begin a class, which may have been my last online class in my room.

All this just makes me upset because I trusted them and told them about my struggles and how I skipped school, so next time I have a panic attack like I did on the day of that math test, I'm not telling them anymore (I have two adult sisters who I feel much more comfortable talking to, one of which is quarantining with us) .",28,2,Beangar

3941,ib9kdn,2020-08-17 07:23:51,AmItheAsshole,WIBTA for refusing to babysit kid during his online classes?,"I just moved back to my parents’ home after my plans fell through for my gap year. I usually babysit this kid who is the son of a family friend for the summer until class starts, usually getting paid like $50 a week (some weeks I didn’t get paid at all). I’m usually okay with this since I went back to college in the fall anyways and to be completely honest, I could only handle him during the summer because he usually hits all of my stressors either accidentally or purposely. He’s basically an only kid who never really learned how to share or to take no for an answer which has gotten him in hot water in the past. I try my best to set up boundaries and try to teach him how to share and other life skills but it usually just backfired. His single parent works a lot and managed to buy him anything that he wants and tries to get him the best things, even if it is very inconvenient for others.

Despite CV, I’m still taking care of him while his parent goes to work. I think it was a combination of a lot of things happening in the past few months including the fact that I wasn’t able to land a full time job yet that made me not really want to babysit him this year but because our parents are close to each other, he still shows up anyways. I figured since he was going to be going back to school anyways, I don’t need to worry about him. 

I recently got lucky and managed to get far into this part time job which would help me with bills. At the same time however, my parents struck a deal with the parent of the kid so I would continue babysitting him while he was in online classes, especially with math, for only $100 a week. This would be cool had they consulted me first and let me know that it was mainly with math because I have an unorthodox method for solving math problems than what they’re teaching now and I know that he will get docked points if he does it a different way. This would also force me to take night shifts which is something that I didn’t want to do. My parents thinks it’s workable and that I would be really be helping out with his parent, so I don’t really know how to approach them with how I felt about this arrangement. 

Without going into too many details about some recent events, I’m no longer comfortable with babysitting the kid beyond summer vacation or trusting his parent with anything they say. There was some things they said/did that really rub me the wrong way and made me not trust them anymore. I know our families are close, but I also need them to know that I’m simply not at the right place nor have the means to juggle a part time job and babysit him at the same time.

My 100+ students class this fall will be taught online, but for the final exam I am free to choose online or offline. I would like the exam to be offline, because I don’t do multiple choice questions and students will need to write many mathematical expressions and draw graphs, so this can’t easily be done on a computer. 

However, some students are international students for whom it may not be easy to be in the country (Korea) to take the exam. I am therefore thinking of an alternative arrangements for those students. So far this is what I can think of:

- Students will have to take the test at the same time as offline testers
- Students will have to join a zoom meeting, have sound on, webcam on, and share the content of their computer screen (which should only be the exam subject). The webcam will have to show a good overview of their working space. 
- Students will have to provide an official entry and exit certificate from the country in which they are two weeks prior to the exam date, to prove they are not in Korea.
- Once they are finished with the exam, they will take photos of their papers and send it by email. 

This is the first brainstorm, but I’m sure their are flaws or things I forgot/didn’t think about, so I’d be more than grateful for any help!

5887,fmckdg,2020-03-21 09:42:09,Professors,Please don't teach your moved-online classes like a typical online class.,"Please consider that many students who signed up for your in-person class did so for a reason. 

Perhaps they could have chosen a different instructor -- but they picked you, for a reason. 

Perhaps they could have signed up for this same course online instead of seated -- but they picked the seated section, for a reason.

I encourage you to consider how you might best take your seated course online, while trying to make it as similar to your original seated course -- and as dissimilar to a typical asynchronous online course! -- as you possibly can.

Personally, the easiest thing for me to do -- and the option that I feel best serves all of my students' needs -- is for us to continue meeting via video conference at the original scheduled lecture times. But since I recognize that many students will no longer be able to meet at the original times, I'll be recording the video lectures for later viewing as well. (Most video conference software such as Zoom makes it super easy to record the session in progress.)

I don't think students expect perfection. I doubt most of them will remember if your dog or kids or whatever causes a minor disruption during your video lecture. What they *are* likely to remember is that during this stressful time, you were one of the few who tried to help them maintain a sense of normalcy and structure... not to mention the social aspect!

So I was doing online classes, My teacher was giving notes as usual.

My sister asked me a shortcut while I was on the call and I not knowing my mic was on told her

the shortcut

Me: Oh its just windows key+shift+s

My teacher in her most Karen voice ever: I'm going to have to remove you for talking during my class  
(even tho literally everyone was talking)

\*Then I get removed\*  
I do understand why she would be upset at me talking during her class but I don't think she should've  
BANNED ME FOR IT,

  
Shortly after I got on a discord call with one of my friends so I could actually GET THE NOTES SO I DONT FAIL MY END OF TERM

  
Then my friend on the call smiles then she immediately removes him.

  
Is it that he cant show enjoyment in doing his work? really Karen.

  
I do feel bad about talking in her class

in the past for online sections of this course, i've given students the link to these videos, as well as the powerpoint presentation file that is displayed in the video. i tell them to print the powerpoint slides &amp; fill them in/take their own notes as they follow along with the video. 

i feel like there must be a better way to get students engaged with lecture videos... but i'm not sure. a few ideas i've come up with are:

1) have students take a low-stakes quiz after the lecture video to test their understanding of concepts

2) have students answer short answer/fill-in-the blank questions about the lecture video via a worksheet of some type as they follow along (could then be turned in for points??)

3) embed media (short video clips etc.) into the videos w/some type of software (my university provides us w/ free access to something called panopto, which is apparently a video recording/editing tool that can do this) 

4) break up my lecture videos into shorter 5-10 min videos AND/OR

5) record my face talking (ICK) &amp; the slides at the same time, instead of just the voice-over powerpoint thing

4829,gbdnhi,2020-05-01 07:23:12,AmItheAsshole,AITA for lying about passing an online class to my family?,"Context:

I am a 15 y/o who for most of my life has been very good at math and really enjoyed math. Last year I took precalc and enjoyed it... for the most part up until near the end of the school year. This school year, I took calculus which I just couldn’t get a grip on, and I miserable failed the first semester, getting about a 47% in the class. The teacher was horrible too, which absolutely contributed to it, but I had lost most interest in math. I dropped the class because it was pointless to continue where I was doomed to fail.

My dad also figured that this was because my algebra skills were not solid, so in comes the class I am currently failing. 

They had me sign up for an online college pre calc class, a class I had already taken and passed. And I literally cannot stand relearning information for a whole class *that lasts a whole semester*. So I begged and pleaded but sure enough, I was still forced to take the class for a few reasons.

They think I’ll like math again if I honed my skills a little better. 

My dad specifically wants me to learn it because he thinks that humans have discovered incredible things, calculus being one of them, and wants me to therefore, learn one of the “great wonders of the world.” While I can appreciate that it is quite... an odd and incredible subject because I still do remember a bit, it’s still not something I have interest in pursuing further. 

My parents also keep telling me that since I want to work with animals when I’m older, I must mean “vet” even though I’ve said many times that I don’t know if being a vet is for me because I’m not a great science person. I don’t know how to respond to this because even if I did want to be a *vet*, I don’t think that calculus applies to it. 

They also want me to replace my grade in calculus before I go to college (I’m a junior), even though we asked the counselor specifically and they said that “replacing grades” isn’t a thing. They think that it will look better to colleges anyway, if they saw that I initially failed something and then was able to overcome it and pass. 

*However,* when I went to the in person check in class, I was told I’d need a *$100 textbook*. I wasn’t able to pick it up that day and forgot about it. I mentioned it once later to my mom but we both forgot about it again. 

I haven’t been able to do the assignments. My parents track my purchases, so I can’t even evasively get the textbook right now. 

I also know that if I *do* bring it up now, they’re going to make me do *literally all of the past work* because they don’t believe in missing assignments ever. So I’m shamefully waiting out the day the class ends so I can confess then. 

To clarify- I’ve been getting away with this so far because it’s a college class which means my parents can’t see my grade.

I just... I feel so guilty for hiding such a big thing from them, and I maybe(?) see some of their points? I think they’re just looking out for me, but it still all feels horrible.

This summer, most of my modules are a week, with the week starting on Wednesday and ending on Tuesday.

Despite explicit instructions to post throughout the module, the typical student will either give three brief responses soon they post their initial post and never return to the post or (more often) wait until Tuesday and brief give their replies then.

This has been the consistent trend despite many emails. It is even part of the grading rubric for the assignment. Has anyone figured out tips for increasing participation in discussion rubrics?

As an aside, there is one thing fighting against me. As part of the class introduction assignment, I ask students why they opted to take the online version of the course.

Last week, our dad saw her playing video games and he got very angry. Now, everyday, he takes away her Switch and her phone and only gives them back after the lectures are done. He checks on her every 30 minutes to 1 hour to make sure she was paying attention. 

Today, I saw her staring at her laptop screen, crying. She was literally sobbing while writing down notes, and I felt really bad for her. I sat her down on the bed and tried to comfort her. She ended up crying herself to sleep. I didn’t want to wake her up, because she looked so tired. 

Our dad came into the room and he started shouting at both of us. He told my sister she was being lazy and entitled, and that I was a terrible older brother for enabling her.

And these same students have the audacity to ask me to just give them an A because “they need the class.”  Why would I want to help you, exactly?  There are times when I just want to email back “karma is a bitch.”  But obviously I don’t.  

Usually, my students are great.  The first classes I taught online this spring were awesome.  I don’t know if it’s just this particular group of students or what...but I’ve never had so much push-back before.

Theres a lot of people that dont like online classes ; think that it doesnt equate to what they paid for / learning. But here me out. 

I really like online classes. I work partially full time sometimes part time week by week. Being able to do my online classes with a employer who doesnt care about my education is beneficial to me keeping my job. Additionally, I actually enjoy not having to live near or on campus. The overpriced rent, the people who dont know how to drive and the constant drama or students in class that would interrupt a lecture over something quite trivial. In my experience online classes was a overall benefit to myself. It is important however to note that there is a large swath of people who prefer in person classes and that is okay. But as i suspect there are many people like me that have to work for a living to pay for aspects of college without any family help. That I am internally a introvert and just hate some of the aspects that come with loud overcrowding on main campus during Greek life events. While prices should be less for online tutition there are two types of college students. 

- Those who have the means and financial capital to do what they want 
- Those who have to work constantly to pay for everything while taking loans out. 

I hope to god most colleges keep online classes in some capacity for 20-30% of all courses. It is financially disastrous for those of us that had to start off with nothing.

In all of the classes you are **required** to turn your camera on or else you’ll get marked absent.

The teachers won’t listen to me telling them about my anxiety and fear of my photo being taken from the meeting.

My parents tell me not to worry and don’t get involved because it’s “not my problem”

But it is my problem:
*I’m* scared to turn *my* camera on because what if what happened to her happens to me.

2036,kwwpsm,2021-01-14 02:56:29,AmItheAsshole,AITA for wanting the room to myself for my online classes?,"I (22F) and my sister (also 22F) have shared a bedroom in our parents' house our whole lives. We are both finishing up college now, and while we both work, our area is very expensive and we can't move out without having to quit school to work full time. Our bedroom is small and dorm-style, so we each have a bed and a desk and not much else room. Our university is hosting classes completely online, and campus is closed due to COVID, so I cannot go to the school library or anywhere on campus to study.

I work on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and have my classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays. My sister has classes every day of the week and works in between them. My sister and I both want the room to ourselves during our live Zoom classes so we can focus. Here was my proposal:

She gets the room from 8:45AM-5:15PM Mondays and Wednesdays, and from 9:00AM-1:30PM on Fridays. I get the room to myself from 9:00AM-3:00PM on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Weekends we share. That way, she gets two full days in the room and a half day on Friday, and so do I. I was thinking this is a completely fair and equal sharing of the room.

My sister says no. She wants the room on Monday, Wednesday, AND Tuesday and Thursday mornings from 9:00AM-11:00AM. We both have a class at that time and she wants the room for that additional time because she thought last semester's room arrangements were unfair to her. Though they might have been, we agreed to them in advance before the semester and now it is over. She wants to ""make up"" for the ""unfair schedule"" she experienced last semester, but that means I only get our room for half the day on Tuesday and Thursday, and she gets it 5 days a week.

I tried to compromise by saying she could have it Tuesday mornings and I have it Thursday mornings, but she interrupted me by saying no. I am pretty mad because I believe I am being more than fair, but she refuses to consider anything but getting the room for all her classes.

Am I the asshole here? In my plan we each have 2.5 days alone in the room for classes and in her plan she has 5 days and I have 3 half-days (1.5 full days.) My sister thinks I am being selfish and unfair to her on purpose, and she won't change her mind.",18,3,pumpkin-jesus

I 28f work full time. Few months back I decided to pursue online language classes and signed up for weekend classes from 2-4 pm for 3 months. 

Till about the half way point things went smoothly. One day my teacher called me on a weekday asking if we could reschedule one class to Friday 7pm instead of Saturday as she had some family commitments. I agreed &amp; attended the Friday class, which didn’t go well as I was mentally exhausted after the full work week. But since I was helping my teacher out, and it seemed to be a one off thing, I didn’t make a fuss. 

Unfortunately since then, things have gone downhill. Every week, I get calls / messages from the teacher asking if we can reschedule the class. The reasons given are all over the place. Sometimes the teacher mentions they need to run personal errands.

Without fail, on Thursday / Friday / Saturday she will call or message me asking if for eg I can join the 7-9pm class or the 8-10am class. I politely told my teacher a few times that all my commitments are scheduled keeping in mind my 2-4pm weekend class timings, such as my dental appointments, vet appointment or even my work routine (we have to work overtime sometimes on Saturday from 9am to 12 pm ) and I can’t keep rearranging things at short notice. 

This week again, my teacher callled me on Thursday and asked if I could reschedule. I politely refused and she sounded angry, but agreed to follow my original schedule. Today (Friday) she messaged again asking if she could move me to a 7pm class. 

Here is where I might be the AH. I sent screenshots of our entire conversation over the last 4 weeks and texted - please note ma’am - I had agreed ONCE to a reschedule basis your request. Despite that, when I asked for a change with 7 days notice I was made to jump through so many hoops. Since then, every week you try and change the timings often with less than 2 days notice despite my explaining my work and personal commitments. 

My teacher immediately called me to apologise and say that there was no need, she would send me the zoom details for the original timing. I was still annoyed and said that if she asks me to reschedule again at such short notice till my course is complete, I would be forced to lodge a complaint 

In my culture we are taught to equate teachers with God, and since then I feel I could have simply refused and not sent screenshots / threaten to complain. But as a student, don’t I also have a reasonable right for a stable routine which isn’t being altered every week?",17,1,The_namster

So this just happened and I wanna bury my head in the sand.

I'm an engineering student and this year, my college decided that we all needed to get some economics in our cvs. I'm not making any judgemnts, I just don't like it, cause I feel like I didn't sign up for this. As such I'm a bit extra frustrated with having to study this alongside other hard stuff.

So, today, we were talking about production–possibility frontier which, in case you don't know, describes a semi-parabola, and the teacher asked someone to find a point on a graph. Since the class is online, as usual nobody answered and, somehow, and **I still can't figure out why**, my teacher thought that the problem was that we didn't know how to solve a quadratic equation, and then, she started teaching **university engineering students** how to solve a damn quadratic equation. Now, I was already fed up with having to wake up to have this class, and now sleepy me would have to endure a 20 minute explanation on pre secondary school maths. I got a little pissed. Thus, I started *very ironically* immitating the teacher like *ohhh look, that's a quadratic equation, uhhhhh yes square root of 4ac over 2a yehhhhhhh*. Was this the best decision I ever made? No. But in my poor, weak teenage mind I thought my mic was off (the magic of online classes).

**It wasn't.**

There was a moment of silence in which I thought all this had been a stupid joke only I had heard; and then I looked at the screen, my mic was on. The teacher, on what I can only describe as slow motion, said *It's a lot of learning, I know*. I was like ***Nah this isn't happening to me***; and then the messages started falling, oh the messages. My phone started going wild, buzzing all over the place, it looked like everyone I damn know was texting me laughing. Oh god. All this was happening at the same time so I just mumbled to the teacher like *Indeed Ms. x, it's a lot,* and didn't say anything since. 

Now I'm in that weird stage in which I know I'll be laughing at this is in a few hours, but not yet. I wanna die hard.

Good thing u can die more if your already dead inside :)

3048,jdmit6,2020-10-18 19:28:05,uAlberta,Does anyone like online classes?,"So I’m seeing a lot of posts talking about how atrocious and hard online learning and school is but am I the only person who genuinely prefers it? Adhd ruins my time management so I’m late pretty often and GAD a lot of the time makes it so even if I’m only 10 min to class, I have to pick between legitimate anxiety attack or no class that day. That being said I heavily relied on either my friends in class helping me with notes, hoping the professor would be a little gracious at my difficulties, and cramming from the text book. This also just made it really hard to even wanna go to class or try to stay caught up on lectures, and I’ve been in the habit of learning whole classes from the text book in a week; in lesser words, I was scraping by the skin of my teeth and always extremely anxious and on edge because of my own faults. 
This semester though? Online has made it so that not only can I sit at home and do all my work without ever being anxious about missing stuff and timing, but I csn learn in class and from the process because it’s just me and a screen not 400 other heart beats and shufflings. I’ve managed to start going to gym 3-4 times a week for the first time since highschool and I think that stems from not being so stressed about actually being at school. 
Honestly typing it out, im kinda reàlizing its less the online format and more so the fact my anxiety and stress has been reduced 100fold that leaves a lot more of my brain free but

Your professor DOES NOT have to make online classes harder to make sure that they remain accredited. Literally not a single accreditation agency has released guidelines on this crisis. Everyone is obviously playing it by ear, and these agencies know there will be some hiccups. The idea that you are going to get stripped of credit after completion of the course came straight out of someone’s ass.

Some people who run courses have talked about the possibility of assigning meaningless busy work just to make courses “harder”. It is their choice to do so, but remember that they are doing so at their own volition and NOT to “keep accreditation”. That is fake news.",17,1,WowPoopy123

This is what happened. A student tells my teacher they can not see his camera and that my teacher is lagging. My teacher asked me if I could see him. I said I could see him.

The student said no one cared about my good internet and that I'm being annoying. She asked the class if they wanted me to flex my internet and everyone used the thumbs down online reaction.   


I got annoyed and thought, if no one wants me here and I don't want to be here I should just leave. Here's where I might've been TA. My teacher started defending me but halfway through his sentence I left. 

Last time I didn't show up to an online class he got my friend to text me to join.

If I put all of the reasons in paragraph form, I'll probably ramble an entire 10k word essay out of it, so here's a list instead :

1. He turns on his camera in a 150 pupil online class when nobody else does. One of the lecturers even discouraged it as it takes up screen space. Many students have pointed it out to him but he was still adamant to show his face to everyone.
2. He constantly jokes around, but scold others for doing the same. He called another student for being rude and inappropriate for complimenting a lecturer. He also shoots down other jokes and sarcastic comments while making them himself.
3. He constantly interrupts the lecturer to ask pointless questions or questions that was clearly going to be explained later on.
4. He also interrupts the lecturer to supply common or useless facts.
5. He keeps saying ""I don't want to boast, but..."" and then went on to boast. He's the only one in the entire 150 pupil class who does this. Examples of his boasts : He claims that his teacher once complimented him that he has a inquisitive mind. He also claims that he has made money as a teenager before (it's not very common in my country).
6. He constantly points out that he's from another country even when it makes no difference to the topic at hand whatsoever.
7. Judging from his comments, he may also be sexist as well.
8. He constantly points out that he's younger than most in the class. (Average age is 17-18, he's 16)
9. Many students have given him hints that the class wants him to shut up, but he either just doesn't get it or was purposefully ignorant of it.
10. Lastly, he's a mac user, and that makes it 10x worse /s

That's it for now... It has only been a month since I first attended class with this guy and he has already risen to become one of my most hated people of all time.

3253,j3p1ow,2020-10-02 05:41:42,ADHD,LPT for my online class homies: learn to crochet and do it during class!,"I started crocheting a few weeks ago and do it during my online lectures. I can’t overstate how much it helps. It’s difficult to stay focused let alone interested and engaged, sometimes even on meds, and instead, I bop around on my computer trying to do other schoolwork, put in grad school apps, check email, anything that feels more productive. 

But when I crochet, all that goes away, even when I’m off meds! I stay focused, yes, but even more excitingly, I feel engaged in the content. Even when my classmates are saying some dumb shit, I don’t need to tune out by starting something else; I just focus on my hands until my professor starts talking again. I *want* to listen and hear everything, and I don’t feel like I’m wasting time every time someone says something dumb or my professor takes a super long pause between words.

It’s just fantastic, and I’m glad I started doing it. 9/10 would recommend. The only downside is that my wrists hurt a l l the time now. But other than that it’s great! Very cheap to start - one crochet hook that was maybe like $4? and one skein of yarn for like $2 or $3. YouTube taught. It took a little bit to figure out what I was doing wrong and get straight lines going, but now I’ve got it down. 

I hope this works for some of you! Please let me know if it does 😊 and hmu if you need any help getting started. It was a bit confusing, frankly, at first figuring out what I need, but I got help from a nice lady at the craft store who then tried to sell me on an MLM.

3933,ibrwxe,2020-08-18 01:53:27,AmItheAsshole,AITA for “bragging” in an online class introduction post?,"So I (F22) am an English/ creative writing major at my university and classes started this week. For most of my classes, we are required to make an “introduction” post where we answer questions provided to us by the professors.

One of the classes that I’m taking is a creative writing course that is supposed to help us expand our portfolio and also build one for those students who don’t yet have one.

One of the questions that the professor asked us in the introduction was “Have yet ever been published? If so, give details.” I’ve taken classes with this professor previously, and they know that I have been published in a few literary magazines as well as anthologies (some of which they recommended I submit to). So, I added all my publications (7 total) in my intro post.

Because this was counted as an assignment, we were also asked to reply to another students post. I posted my response, and then logged on later in the day to reply to another students when I noticed a classmate had replied to mine. This classmate, who I’ll call Brad, replied to my introduction saying that there was no way I had that many publications as an undergrad student and that I was being a show off and making other students in the program who hadn’t had the privilege of being published feel bad. 

I didn’t want to start anything so I ignored his comment, but as I was reading through the rest of the students posts, I noticed a few had probably seen Brad’s reply and agreed with him, as they were also making comments about how “most of us here don’t have any publications since we are all grad students”. Brad was the only one who had directly replied to me but the rest of the responses seemed to be directed at my post. I also got a few direct messages from students asking if the publications were “real” and saying I didn’t have to be a show off and I could have just said I had been published without listing them all and making others feel bad. 

I don’t feel bad for listing my publications as it was literally asked of me, and also my professor is aware of these publications so I’m not gonna lie about how many times I’ve been published. I mentioned this to my sister and some friends, and I’ve gotten some divided answers; some of my friends say I shouldn’t have listed my publications because it made me sound snobby and obnoxious and I should have expected these kinds of replies when I posted it but I disagree and my intentions were not to show off, but I might be biased.

2753,jvqwqv,2020-11-17 10:41:00,college,I'm stuck in a dilemma with renting an apartment and online classes (advice is welcome),"Hello all,

I haven't seen this being discussed too much, but here's the dilemma:

My uni isn't making classes online anytime soon. Even when their numbers spiked earlier this semester, they doubled down on keeping school open. I'm only doing one other class right now.

So for next spring, I would have to get an apartment in order to continue my degree. Well, guess what? If I do that, and classes move online (a very likely scenario), then I'm stuck paying $1k/month for an apartment just to do online classes.

If I decide not to risk getting stuck in a lease just to do online classes, then I can only take one class (which is technically a gap semester for me). I can only do Spanish online, there's literally no other classes for me to take online after that (I'm a senior in mechanical engineering). Not only will I delay my graduation further by doing this, but I'm going to lose my stamina and possibly struggle upon returning in fall 2021. Not likely, but possible.

So to summarize, I can't decide between:

* Renting an apartment for next spring, and possibly getting sick or having my classes moved online mid-term, leaving me stuck in an expensive lease, or;
* Waiting for classes to move online at the start of the semester (taking them at my parents' house). However, they may never go online and I have to take another semester off, which may make it harder for me to get back into learning mode.

Sorry if that sounded a bit confusing, I tried to be as succinct as possible.

Now, before you ask:

*Can't you transfer to another school?* No. As much as I want to, it's not possible for me. The in-state engineering schools are not moving online anytime soon. The out-of-state schools have the same problem, plus they cost way more and my credits are less likely to transfer.

*How can your uni not offer any online option for you?* It's absurd. They have a plethora of online classes, but not a single one in my major is offered online. I guess it's like with nursing or other technical skills where you really need hands-on learning.

So thank you for reading. I could really use some advice right now.",15,3,enriqueg9031

It’s $16 for an ebook of our required textbook that you get immediate access to, and I had been debating posting it in the class Q&amp;A anyway because hey cheap books are freaking awesome, right?

Anyways, a classmate that I’ve had before (so I know she’s not a new student) posted saying she’s having financial troubles and won’t be able to get the required textbook until Week 4 and asked if anyone could send her pictures of the required reading.
We have ish 30 pages to read per week, so that’s kind of a lot of time to be spending to help somebody who didn’t prepare on their own.

My thought process behind pointing her to the cheap ebook was that she could cancel whatever she’s ordered (if she did- not sure) and save some money as well as have immediate access to the required book, thereby not needing someone else’s time in order to do her work. 

To me, time is hands down the most precious commodity. I have a husband, kids, and a job, plus whatever homework comes out of online school (Illustration so it eats a lot of time). Time is precious.

But there were at least three who were having some kind of conversation with someone in the room with them. One guy was just talking with someone off to his side for a solid 2 - 3 minutes when I turned his camera off. Another young woman was giggling almost non-stop because, apparently, someone in the room with her was saying/doing something funny. Those were the worst cases. There was more of the same from some other students but less intense/prolonged.

There was also one whose roommate(?) walked by behind my student mostly undressed. On the way to the shower maybe? But I didn't see that, so there's nothing I need to do about it just yet. I must have been looking at my notes when that happened.

I taught online last spring, but I don't remember the problem being this bad. I only had to speak to one student. Anyway....the reason I post....

I'm willing to entertain the idea that I'm out of touch, I don't understand how video/virtual communication and interactions work in 2021, and I'm projecting my cranky old outdated norms on young people.

But I feel very distracted by this kind of thing. If it's ""just me,"" I suppose I can get over it. But I suspect that there are other students who do want/need to pay attention, and this kind of thing is probably somewhat distracting to them.

Happened Yesterday during English class, which was the Last class of the Day. And I have a habit of getting rather impatient in the last class. Especially when teacher is teaching Grammar.

So the deed was done, and I didn't know what to do so I just closed the class, switched off my phone so none of my friends can message me and skipped today out of shame. Too scared to face the truth, but I don't think I am gonna get suspended or anything because my parents are not aware of this little incident. Unless the teacher is waiting to first speak to me, which can be the case and the suspense killing me.

I am planning to pass it off as my brother pranking me but I know that no ones gonna believe that so yea, I am just kidding. Probably.... But most of all, its gonna be SUPER!!! awkward to go to school tomorrow, cuz I called in sick today.

Anyways, either my teacher is gonna eat me alive or my mom. So nice knowing you guys!

The Lesson: NEVER think no one can hear you. If you want to vent make sure to not only check the room but also the Microphone no matter how sure you are that you had switch it off. God knows when we will end up regretting it.

1743,lbqkzy,2021-02-03 15:54:05,CollegeRant,Whoever decided on a half online class needs to be fired.,"Yes, I get that we can't do normal classes because of COVID. Yes, this class has enough students so that they all can't fit in a classroom with social standing (even though just skipping a seat isn't really enough, but oh well). But screw this class.

I have to take a physics class for my major and it's a Monday-Thursday class and they decided that the class would be split in half, with a half goes to class (with the other half attending though a Webex link), and then the next day the halves switch roles. So when you are in the class room everything is good, but you will hate life when you are in the Webex room. The professor's microphone cuts out a lot, the webcam is at best a 480p  camera (to the point that you can't tell the difference between a E and q), and the digital class itself cuts out at times. We have a group chat for this class and during class it is filled with people asking ""what did she write?"", ""what did she say"", ""did the class cut out?"", ""is her audio choppy to anyone else?"" and so forth. Also she has the sound muted on the computer so if you have a question when you're online you hope that someone in class has the Webex open. Also she doesn't record these, so if you miss anything, oh well.

I have to admit on paper this seems like a good idea, but damn if these people didn't ruin the execution. I know for a fact they can afford decient cameras and microphones (they charge $1000 per student, 30+ students and that's just this class), but nah, let's buy the cheapest and lowest quality webcam we can find. The selfie camera on my last phone (an LG Stylo 3 with a crappy 5MB selfie camera) was better than the webcams this college bought.",14,14,Starkiller525

2746,jvuk0v,2020-11-17 15:07:53,tifu,TIFU by unmuting during my online class,"This just happened, and I’m sure I’ll remember this for a while. So my class was just about to finish, so I was launching a game called rust to play, but I loaded in to the sound of rockets. For people who don’t know what rust is, you basically build bases and get guns through pvp, and people will try to raid your base to get your guns and everything else. So the sound I loaded in to was people inside my base trying to steal everything. 

So I click the button on my headset to unmute my mic, knowing I clicked the mute button on teams so I thought I’d be fine. I said something to them in game, and then my teacher stopped talking and asked if someone had their mic unmuted and I thought to myself “what idiot forgot to mute themselves.” Well, turns out that idiots me. 

Whenever you unmute your mic on your headphones, teams also decided to unmute on there too, so everyone heard be talking in game. My teacher said she’ll talk to me tomorrow when I’m in class about it, so let’s hope she finds it funny.

TL;DR: I load into a game since my meetings ending, unmute my mic on my headset to talk in game but turns out everyone on the meeting can hear me too, and the teacher said she’ll talk to me tomorrow.",14,7,DiamondForce2

2999,jgh1vo,2020-10-23 05:35:02,tifu,TIFU by trolling in online class.,"So I was in a physics class when it started. I opened Microsoft Teams in another tab and joined the online class with someone else's name. I started playing sound effects and got kicked out. **Funny**. Then, the same day I tried to join a biology class. **Tried**. The teacher noticed that I was not who I say I am. I started joining with other classmates' names. And the teacher was videotaping everything. She handed everything over to the director and the director handed it over to the fucking *POLICE*. That's right. What I did is actually *ILLEGAL* and can result in a *FINE*. The thing is not only did I get reported, but my classmates actually want to beat up the dude behind that prank. (me). They didn't know it was me, but the teacher alerted the parents of the people I impersonated, and one of my best friends actually got into an argument with his parents and now I officially feel like a piece of shit.

The teachers don't know that this was from my class, they think someone actually LEAKS the meeting links to some mothertruckers. That ""places a bigger target on my head"". It's all ridiculous because it's really harmless what I did. But teachers don't take jokes lightly. :(

When we pivoted to online in the spring I didn't worry too much about making class engaging because, frankly, I didn't have much time to prepare at all. Now that I have some planning time going into the summer session I'm more concerned about making the class as engaging and interactive as possible. This is especially important because my program director is requiring that all classes be synchronous and the class meets for 3 hours a day for three days out of the week. That is a lot of time to sit in front of a computer screen.

6145,euky8e,2020-01-27 07:59:40,CSULB,What would happen to my financial aid if I were to drop an online class halfway through the semester?,"Truth be told, I'm not even sure if it's appropriate to be asking such a question on here and if it is, please let me know so I can delete it or take it down.

To be honest, I only really need 8 units left to graduate, and both are fulfilled by 2 4-unit accounting courses that I need to finally graduate. However, I'm piss-poor and really need the financial aid so I enrolled for two 3-unit online courses just to get full-time and reach the 12-unit requirement for the aid.

Last semester I asked for advice on which easy online classes I could take so I can easily pass and focus on my two accounting classes. I took Gerontology 400 and Music 468 based on the replies I got. I didn't realize GERN 400 was a writing intensive capstone and requires all this effort from me. I already passed my capstones in the past two semesters so I don't really want to have to write more and more essays on top of the reports I have to just from my accounting classes. MUS 468 is more lax in that regard and seems easier for me, plus the material is something I'm actually interested in since I love film and music.

My question is, would it be okay to drop GERN 400 in the future, maybe halfway through the semester (around 8 weeks?) so I would be able to focus more on my more important classes? I don't mind keeping MUS 468 since I'm interested in the subject but things change and I might consider dropping that, too. However, I'm more concerned with GERN 400 because I don't want it taking too much of my time and effort when I could project it more towards accountancy.

Thank you very much and sorry for long wall of text. And sorry if the topic and question are not allowed, if so I will take this down. Thanks again :D",14,1,KDRain395

Yeah 6 hrs lng pero hindi pa kasama yung mga learning task, performance task and such na pinapagawa. Halos lahat na ay digitalized.

Pero ang concern ko lang is; natututo paba ang mga bata?

To myself, hirap na ako matuto talaga. Lagi pakong natutukso ng brainly. At may mga time pa na napapa FB, YT, or any types of social media na considered na distraction. Hindi ko lang alam sa iba (around my age) pero kasama pa yung sudden interruption gawa ng sa bahay nga; running errands, cooking, cleaning, etc.

Ask ko lang kung ganito rin sa inyo? I mean, it really stressed the brain to process so much stuff. Tapos yung mga teacher kung mag bagsak ng gawain andami x number ng teacher. Yung deadline matagal nga pero wala ng time para mag relax mentally/physically/emotionally kaya madalas na bu-burn out.

And because of this I also realize na most of the things na pinapagawa ay useless...? No, hindi ako against sa curriculum pero impractical? Like seriously, two to three years nalang legal age na. So pwede na mag work work para sa sarili. 

Shouldn't the school teach a much better lessons to prepare childrens in real life? Tax? Savings? Practices? Relationship? 

Ewan ko kung may sense pinag sasabi ko gulong gulo narin ako. Sa mga seniors here, please enlighten me...

Edit: Hindi ko na alam talaga. wala narin akong gustong gawin para sa future...just constant mental suffering",13,4,MatalinongBOBO

I was bullied a lot growing up and always have trouble being in a group. Anyway this class is to see if you would like to be a counselor one day and is once a week. I didn't realize how hard it would be and how much you have to open up about yourself, if I knew it was this tough I don't think I would have done it. The smaller group we branched out had two other people and we were talking about what counseling we had done and what we found difficult. I  said how I have always struggled with assertiveness and found it really difficult to assert myself in counselling sessions, that I would just let little things go instead of bringing them up. Next think I know the woman in the group Emily goes in a condescending tone"" well if you have trouble asserting yourself in a therapy sessions, I don't know how you assert yourself in life"" and rolling her eyes. I was immediately taken aback, and the conversation moved on. 

This was my opportunity to assert myself to someone who I felt disrespected by, and I didn't do it, instead I sat there like a deer in head lights looking into a camera and was dumbfounded. I am really mad at myself for not saying anything, I could have even said, "" I didnt like the way you said that "" instead I just was shocked and felt embarrassed I even said that. The teacher said the group was a safe space to be honest, that we all must respect one another. After this persons comment in the class I don't feel it is a safe space to be honest. I felt very judged. I don't want to bring it up next week and make a big deal of it, but I did feel it was out of line. I could tell the teacher of the course but then I would be making a deal of it. I don't know, what would you do? I'm just mad I missed my chance to assert myself. This always happens to me where someone hurts my feelings and I don't know how to respond.",13,1,Zia0

I help them with their homework and we share cute cat pictures and stuff etc. Most of them have been really struggling with online school and keeping up with it, which I totally understand cause I am too. I found out today that some of them have just been skipping class altogether and have poor attendeance. This is mostly because they have no sleep schedule and often oversleep and miss classes completely. I told them both that it is hard but they need to get through school and this means that they need to fix their sleep schedules. They need to go to class and try their best and that I am always here to help them but high school is something they need to get through. If they're genuinely struggling then they need to talk to a teacher or parent otherwise they're just gonna end up in huge trouble when they have submitted zero assignments. They need to get a sensible sleep schedule and not drink coffee before bed and turn their devices off so they can actually sleep.   


I tried to be as kind as possible and I do understand that everything is a lot harder rn and it can be hard to find motivation. I personally almost failed two years in a row because depression was kicking my ass and I've found this year hard too but I'm making sure to look after myself and do as much as I can. These two both stay up all night playing among us and end up going to sleep at 5 am and I think that is probably their main problem or at least part of it. I want to help them and I want to see them both get through school. But they said I was being an inconsiderate asshole and that I don't understand, and they told some of their other friends who also agreed that I was being an asshole and that school isn't that important.",13,1,destinymaster1234

It's almost September and that's always the worst month for hurricanes, and sometimes i've had no electricity for weeks or months if the storm is super bad.

I want to remind you that many students have a bad family situation so they have waited years to go to college to be away from home. For them, online school does not only mean paying the cost of in-person courses (8 times more for international students!) but also going back to a toxic family environment with no escape. The switch to online school had also led to thousands of students paying hefty amounts just to keep their housing, students and their parents losing jobs and delays in people's career plans (those who are deffering the semester or taking a gap year) - to name a few.

We are all smart enough to get into UBC so we clearly understand that the switch has been done for the safety of our community. However, it is reasonable for people to feel anger towards the situation since it is a huge compromise that we are all making (financially, emotionally and time). Even more so for international students as our friends go to university all over the globe, and many large universities in the US (including NYU!), Switzerland and other countries are operating normally and opening in August (despite having 80% more covid cases than BC). 

It is justifiable to be disappointed in BC and UBC's decision to make fall online, especially when we take into consideration BC's low covid toll. After all, fall semester is stealing a semester away from our time in university - which we worked hard for years to get into. 

P.S: To those who will reply saying 'covid will steal our health if we go back in the fall', please be open minded enough to see the point I am making here :)",13,7,homeboy84

the second i start screen sharing, big badonkers fill the screen as they jiggle with all their might, with loud high pitched anime moaning in the background.

i could feel my soul leave my body as i saw the reactions of my classmates and teacher. i wanted to kill myself right there and then. still want to.

i struggled to stop sharing my screen as my hands were shaking and i felt dizzy due to intense embarrassment. i finally ended the stream and left the call. 

i later wrote an apology email to my teacher, and rescheduled my presentation. i just cannot face my class ever again, especially offline in school.

We were all just chilling on the Zoom, taking our test, and periodically my teacher would excuse the kids who completed the test.

I (17F) am  the only senior in this class, with a couple of juniors and mostly freshman, since it is an entry level CTE class. 

All of a sudden this girl (who has always been a part of our class) starts talking extremely graphically about what she wanted our teacher to do to her, whilst clearly doing... you know. Luckily the camera wasn't on but it didn't take a genius to make that leap. 

Our teacher, bless him, was completley unfazed and kicked her and reported it to the admins. 

But in the chat, a lot of the kids were typing about how uncomfortable they felt. I was too, I have a bad anxiety problem and I could feel a panic attack building. It was scary, and I feel really bad for the younger kids in my class. They are so young and clearly not as well-equipped to deal with what just happened.  It wasn't just a zoom-bombing, but sexual harrassment. 

Now, I don't know what was going on with the girl. But if it really wasn't a joke, I hope she gets all of the mental health support she needs. That doesn't excuse the harrassment she did against our entire class, though. 

Anyways, I just wanted to rant. Has anyone else had reaply disturbing zoom events, and how did your schools deal with them? I feel like mine won't do much.",12,1,ouchiethathurts

I go to a community college in the US, and all of my classes were in a classroom setting and kept online stuff to a minimum. Recently, with the virus outbreak shutting schools down, all of my classes have been switched to online only (which I’ve been avoiding because I don’t do well with anything school related online). So far, my profs havent posted any online lectures, meetings, or any resources, but continue to flood student with endless work. Not only that, but the app we use (Blackboard) is the shittiest app simply because it is so difficult to navigate. 

Before the shut down, I kept my GPA relatively high and everything was going well, but the switch to online everything really has me stressed out of my mind, and I’m lacking motivation to do any of the work simply because I find class way better when I’m in a classroom setting and able to ask questions and listen to the professor speak on a topic.

I have a couple of students whose posts are very similar and I suspect they are a) working together and one of them slightly modifies the post and submits a new one as their ""own"" work, or b) the plagiarizer is just copying the first student's post and changing some phrasing without the first student's knowledge.

I'm inclined to think it's probably the first option, but in either case, the wording is not exactly the same so I can't outright say ""you copied that other student, here's your zero"", but I don't want to just let it go either.

I'm considering sending them both an email (separately) giving them a heads up that someone else is using wording very similar to their work and remind them of the policy on not sharing answers, etc. But then I worry that comes off as accusatory if the student whose work is being copied honestly has no idea.

alam kong dahil online learning kami kaya ganito pero normal lang ba yung kahit asynch, nagpapattendance? di na ko magtalk sa fact na inassume agad nila na lahat kami may stable internet at no choice kami sa setup na maybe because scihigh kami AHAHAHAHAHA kahit mga modular or college pwede po kayo sumagot para lang sana makagain lang ako ng insight about your daily sched in this distance learning",11,1,tbzkeeper

The thing is that I only finished and passed 42 credits worth of classes. That’s an average of 7 credits per semester. If I go at the pace I’ve been going, it would take me 6 more years just to graduate with a bachelors. I’ve been doing part time school because of a mix of mental/health issues, laziness, and other responsibilities. I always try to do full time school, but I either drop a few classes right away or withdraw from them midterm. I’ve wasted about $6000 on withdrawn classes. I did some math and found that I could graduate in 2 years if I take 14 or 15 credits a semester AND a few classes in each summer, which is very doable. I just don’t know if I’m up for it. I am doing better health-wise and more stable overall, but I’m scared that I’m just going to fall into the same habits as the past 3 years. I feel like I just need systems and strategies. I always fall behind to the point where it’s extremely stressful and I withdraw so I don’t fail or completely burnout. I just need to start doing the work as soon as I can, which is for some reason easier said than done. I need to start taking good notes and studying all of the material before the night prior of the test. I feel like it shouldn’t be so hard but it is for me. It’s especially hard with online classes since you don’t have as much guidance. I’ve made the decision to take online classes this semester and next semester. I think I’m going to set aside the same chunk of time everyday to do schoolwork. Maybe focus on one class per day. I don’t know. Any advice is welcome.",11,1,Intelligent-Box-9017

I usually have nothing to do during non-ap classes, so I started organizing and deleting the apps on my phone. For a bit of backstory, I'm allowed 2 hours of using my phone/computer in one day with the exception of using it for school purposes. So my mom saw me using my phone and she tells me why I'm doing it when I'm not allowed to. At the moment I thought she was being really annoying and just dismissed her with mumbling. She kind of gets mad at this point and I realized another argument was coming. She tells me I have to self study during classes and I tell her I really can't imagine myself willingly studying during this time. So I put down my phone, and go outside to cook breakfast. She gets even madder at this and starts yell-talking. She tells me it's wrong to cook when my other classmates are at school learning and calls me a loser. I tell her that they might be at school, but I'm not and it's okay to be lax, to which she responds that my way of thinking is wrong and that I should shut up and listen to her when she's teaching me the right way to think. She says I need to get out of her house if I'm not going to follow her rules. My dad comes out of the room and tells me to go inside the room and that I'm being nonsensical, and I do. At this point, I'm crying to myself because I think it's unfair for him to shut me up like that because he knows I'm scared of him and can't retaliate. I know I'm being selfish, but I don't want to take all the blame and be treated like an uneducated child. They always do that to me in arguments; they tell me if I don't want to be treated like a child that I should stop acting like one. Who's in the wrong here?

* Click to mute one student who won't stop watching TV? it mutes the student answering your question.
* Click to underline a sentence? the answer appears and the student sees it when they're not supposed to.
* Click to rename something? it boots your student from the lesson.

In the middle of another (already difficult) lesson being ruined by the interface, I totally lost my cool and flipped off my computer screen with both hands and fully intent facial expression mouthing the words ""f\*ck you"". Now usually, this wouldn't matter cause we teach with the camera off. But....that was when my camera decided to randomly turn on (likely consequence of touching the wrong button due to a resized screen).

I panicked and ended the lesson abruptly. Went back on about ten minutes later and said my internet died. Lesson continued on shitty as usual. No mention of the double middle fingers so far.... I'm just waiting to get a call from my supervisor or something. Dying on the inside a little. Anyone else here ever drop the ball like this?

Well when I came back into the room I decided to go through my suitcase on the bed next to the couch I was using zoom on to look for my hand sanitizer...well when I turned around I realized the camera was directly facing me the whole time. I looked through the streams of my classmates to see if any had noticed and sure enough a good few were trying not to laugh and making awkward glances at the screen. After a few seconds of minor embarrassment I looked down and realized MY WHOLE DICK had somehow shifted during the walk to my room/through all my searching in the suitcase and was  completely out of the hole in my underwear. It had likely been in full view for anyone watching me search my stuff. Hopefully my potato quality camera softened the blow a bit.

773,p06k6q,2021-08-08 02:34:47,CSULB,Should I take five online classes for the Fall semester or…?,"Hello! (This is my first Reddit post haha)

I’m a transfer student and I have a dilemma about my pending schedule for the Fall semester. 

I’m currently enrolled in five online classes for the Fall semester. Although I’ll be at home keeping up with these classes, I am wondering if it might be overwhelming… so I’m considering dropping one. If I do drop one class, I will be able to fit that dropped class for either the winter or summer. 

Ideally, I’d like to take that one class during the winter, but there’s a couple reasons why I’m hesitant about taking a Winter Session. 

One: it’s an accelerated period since it’s roughly four weeks. If anyone’s taken a winter course, how was the pace like? Was it manageable? Are professors more strict and less lenient with assignments?

And two: the tuition fee during the Winter. It’s $296 per unit, so a 3 unit class would be roughly $900, which is so much to pay out-of-pocket and there’s no financial aid specific to Winter sessions. (And the summer is much more steep, fee wise.)

So I would like some opinions. For this Fall semester, should I take five online classes without financial stress, and adapt my time management skills for the semester? Or… take four during the fall, and pay for one class (3 units) for a Winter session?

I hope I explained this well 😅",10,1,imjimini

Lots of people use online class assistants now (r/writingservice, r/dissertation, r/collegepaperpro, etc.) and I think it's possible to do it in a way that is ethical.  Right?  I want to learn everything in every class.  I'm just talking about the logistics.  

An assistant can help manage my schedule, troubleshoot problems, and help me carve out time to study.  It seems more and more common now for busy professionals to hire an assistant to help with a class, but I bet people have different opinions about this. I have been poor and struggling most of my life, and now I want to excel in my new job position, which is very difficult.  

I have to complete grad school because I got a promotion at work. My job is extremely difficult. 

So I am trying to optimize everything, and part of that is learning how to work with an assistant effectively.  Does anyone have any experience with this?  How does one ethically work with a research assistant or dissertation consultant, etc.?",10,1,Makeitnicenice

However, faculty and the more outspoken student body (because of their extraversion) don't which is a bummer.","I am a sophomore at a top-ten business school my majors set up to thrust me into economics and policy as a career. I was in semester two of my freshman year when lockdowns started.

**I LOVED ONLINE CLASSES**. 

* ***They save commute time***. I find them to be so much more efficient than commuting all the way to class in person only to have to relearn everything when I get out of class. I dreaded having to leave my dorm room just to go to lecture. 
* Sometimes, I didn't even go because I didn't see a point unless attendance was part of my grade, but even then I maxed out the number of times I can miss class. Last year before COVID hit, ***I don't think I learned much from attending lectures in person***. I had to learn everything on my own time. 
* Not only that, but the nature of ***online classes convinced most professors to make their exams open book and open note*** which is why I think I did fairly better in some classes than I otherwise would have had COVID not hit. I feel sorry for those who had to take some of the classes I am taking now *in person* where the exams were not open-note. The classes weren't necessarily *difficult* but we had to remember a lot of minor details that can easily be mixed up with other concepts. This open-note policy better reflects how the real world works. Yes, we need to know some basic concepts but I think college should be about skills instead of the content itself. Plus, if you look at your notes or online for help on a concept enough times, you will eventually grasp the concept.
* I am disappointed that no business or economics professor is offering online classes next semester. Even the classes that satisfy the world culture credit requirement are only offering classes that do not interest me. I am DREADING the re-opening of campus. As I said before, I barely learn anything in lectures. On top of that, **my social struggles cause me to feel serious envy when I see others form relationships in person while I just** ***can't*** (2 years in college and I have only made ONE friend who is graduating this year and moving to New York). I don't get why flexible courses aren't an option. It's not that hard to just renew a Canvas course. After all, the content and videos *are already on there*. I even voiced these viewpoints to a professor but he was adamant about keeping all his classes in person because in his experience, students retain information better in that mode of instruction. I suspect I will struggle academically as well as socially next semester.",10,1,redditeconliberty

So today i had some online classes and the lesson wasn't important, so... you know... i just started looking at some nsfw memes.

Our school changed ""apps"" from MS Teams to zoom so from last monday we work on zoom.

Now you might think ""hey ya wanker why should i care?""
Well, mainly because that will be important.

Our teacher was checking attendance, so for a second I clicked on zoom again (because i don't have mic, you know what i mean?). I am last on ""check list"", so after my teacher confirmed attendance first thing he saw was... well... Harry Styles' face wearing nipples as earrings...

How it happened... well somehow when i clicked to type that i'm present and clicked on Harry again, zoom kind of bugged or glitched, so when i clicked to next page on Harry site, my computer screen was shared. 

My teacher was talking about something and when he clicked back on zoom he just stopped mid-sentence. For 10 seconds i was like... ""well nice Harry but why did he stop mid-sentence?""

I click back on zoom and see someone (i thought it was someone) sharing their screen (when you are on a meeting it shares what you see, so a meeting, and that's why i couldn't figure out who it was). I forgot to turn off my mic, because i'm mainly quiet (yes dummy move). I said ""why the fuck is someone sharing their screen?"".

And then: ""OP, I am sorry but i think your mic has fixed, and most importantly, coupd you please turn off screen sharing?""

Now, you might think at this point it's all over and me embarrased, bot oh boy do i feel sorry for ya.

After teacher said his words i said quietly ""holy fuck"", then louder, because i had my mic on and i knew i fucked up ""holy shit"", and then even louder and more and more embarrased ""oh fuck shit no"" and at the end : ""oh sorry i am so sorry"". At this point i imagined myself without friends and laying on the street begging for social experiment prankers to give me food. I was dead inside.

Then i hear giggling. Like stopping you hardest laugh. And NO, it was not my classmates. My teacher burst out laughing and THEN my classmates after him. I wass confused like never before. And i burst out laughing from embarassment. I pretended so.eone else did what i just did, so noone would hear crying in my laugh. That has been going for 5 next minutes. Just laughing. I felt like after a 2 hour workout or giving birth. After those painful 5 minutes everyone kind of chilled but for the rest lesson everyone giggled when they had to say something.

This teacher is a God to me right now. He messaged my via zoom chat that he won't report it anywhere and it made him smile for the first time after a crappy week. He told me that everyone makes mistakes and i am not the only one watching some nsfw stuff (yes he did say that).

I didn't tell anyone from my family that it happened, i prefer sharing this to almost 17 milluon people.

So, that was my story. First time posting here, i kinda hope i will be posting more but on the other hand i don't want to make any mistakes and fuck-ups like this.

Hope I made ya laugh.

See you soon, maybe...

I am leaving at 3pm from my bf's apartment(which is about 35 minutes from my parents) and will arrive no later than like 3:45. My class starts at 4pm which I literally just listen to a lecture and do stuff in the background while he talks- the class is almost over and I have an A+.

I will have plenty of time to cook the chicken dish we are taking to my Grandpa as it only takes 30 minutes maximum which would get us at like 4:30 pm(maybe 4:45 at latest) which my class isn't over until 5:15pm so we can't leave until class ends. 

 She is all moody with me over it just because she knows I am probably not gonna be leaving until 3pm due to the fact that I was streaming for 2 hours with my friends on Youtube. She is irritated that I am not home because she is out of control of what I am doing. 

She texts me ""There is no reason you need to leave that late!""

AITA for not leaving earlier to prepare the food?",10,1,Timely-Fish4976

1.  How do classes that require a social component work?  An example of this is symphonic band, or orchestra.  With some students having lagging wifi, I imagine there is no good way for every single student to sync up perfectly when it comes to playing their instrument...right?  Another possibly social class is physical education.  How does that work online?  Are you doing aerobics on video chat?  Are you required to film yourself running around the neighborhood?  What if you don't live in a safe neighborhood to run around in?
2. How do classes that require special equipment work?  One such example is ceramics.  Are you just working with modeling clay, taking pictures of your sculptures, and posting it for your classmates to see?  Another example is wood/metal/auto shop.

so because we’re doing online classes, i’ve seen tones of people in my school/class and just on social media generally not doing the work and missing assignments. but i have. 

currently, i’ve only missed one assignment.

i feel awful about myself as it’s become a stereotype that people who are doing the work aren’t cool and are “boring bitches”. and i usually don’t try to listen to others negatively but it’s making me think about myself. even my friends are beginning to call me boring and are trying to persuade me not to do the work.

but i don’t think they understand that i CANT. to give a quick backstory, i am the youngest in my family, and my siblings aren’t really academically clever and stick in at school. so my parents rely on me. i feel guilty, not for the teachers, but everyone else if i don’t do the work. i want to succeed in school but now people are seeing that as a bad thing and shining a positive light on people who don’t do work?

in school, i’m not a swot/swat (can’t remember the spelling) but just an all-around well-behaved student who does their work. but i do it so i don’t need to stop back and can do my own things when i get home.

i was just wandering if anyone else is in the same boat and is doing online school work or possibly has any ideas how i can ignore people in my class name-calling me for being productive?

— thanks :)

I had to drop precalc because the professor made us learn through watching videos and I just couldn't learn like that. When I took it in the summer, I basically had to live at the tutoring center just to graze a C. 

This semester I'm taking ochem 2 and genetics so far online classes feel just like online precalc. My professors cant draw out mechanisms or put detailed examples on a chalk board. All we're doing is looking at PowerPoint slides and just talking. 

Also, I have labs. My ochem professor is expecting us to do lab reports based on the experiments he recorded himself doing. It sucks to have that lab experience taken away but it's also harder to hold my lab partners accountable. I have a lab due tomorrow at noon and one of my lab partners just opened the document an hour ago. We'd usually write the report together. 

I feel like if I had taken my art history or English lit class I wouldn't be having these problems. I'd probably just read the book, do homework, and be done.

One was a lighter shade and fluffier.,"So my older son (B) who is in college and back home because his school is online for the rest of the semester. B rarely complains about what my younger son (C) who is in high school does that annoys him. Like only if he knows the car needs gas and doesn’t fill it up, leave his clothes on the bathroom floor and has his music too loud and won’t turn it down even if B asks C to do that. Today B was having class online and C came in complaining that B picked the same color towel as C. B did pick the exact same towel as C a few weeks ago when he was home for spring break. This time B’s towel was a slightly lighter shade of color and fluffier than C’s. C comes to where B is currently in class and says “Your a f ing a hole for picking the same color towel as me” B’s mic was on and luckily only the professor and one other student who B is good friends with (and completely understands what just happened) was on at the time (as it was a few minutes before the class started)

B wants me to email the professor to explain what happened wasn’t his fault. Would that be weird for me to do? 

B also wants me to punish C but I don’t know how to punish him because his school is out for at least 3 weeks as of Monday 3/16. 
I told C he is getting punished for what he did but I have to talk to his mother to figure out what punishment he should receive. That was a partial lie. I will punish C but told his mother that I will ask reddit (this post) what punishment he should receive

When I confronted C he told me that B has been messaging current high school freshman and sophomores. He asked them “How tall are you” C knew that he was doing that because a couple messaged C to tell him what B was doing. I haven’t told B about what C told me until I discuss with reddit. Again I lied and said that I need to discuss with his mother. Should I punish B? If I should punish B would you recommend me NOT punishing C for what he did as B’s punishment?

I've only ever taken one campus class that my great aunt doesn't know about cuz my parents don't really consider it a class (It was more of a skills lab). I have really bad social anxiety, I  don't want to have to ride public transportation every day and I also don't like driving. Ever since my freshman year, my great aunt found out I was taking online classes and got really upset at me saying things like, ""They're not beneficial"" ""You'll do better in an actual class"" ""Online classes are for lazy people"" ""You won't get any social interaction"" etc. Well, every phone call since then consisted of at least 5 minutes of her asking me about my classes and her pressuring me to go to campus which just makes me not want to even more. Well, yesterday, she called again, and she was, as usual, asking me about when I will finish online classes and why don't I start going to campus and all that other stuff. I told her that I only have one more pre-college class and that the rest are all college classes and she asked if after I pass this class that I would go to campus. I kinda just said, ""...yeah, maybe"" even though I didn't really want to. Well, during the last 5 minutes of our phone call, she finally asked me, what even was an online class? (After 2 freaking years of her complaining) she thought it was all self-directed and I'm like, ""No, there's actually teachers that teach you and have discussions with you."" And she just said, ""Oh, ok, I thought it was self directed"" I was thinking like, 'Was the reason you didn't want me to take online was because you thought it was all self-directed??'",10,1,520woaini520

1630,ll1e7d,2021-02-16 10:50:57,tifu,TIFU by making my mon think I was watching porn during online class,"Alright so this just happened twenty minutes ago and I’m still cowering with fear as to how I’m gonna face my mom, and explain the situation to her after this.
I’ll start from the beginning. I was in an online class from 3-4 (it is now 4:04), and at about 3:45, I get a news notification titled “Salma Hayek cries during sex scene”.
Naturally, this caught my attention and I opened this article to read more. As I read the article I was like “hmm okay this is why she was crying” and then a small ad on the side of the page started to play on full volume, alerting my mother that I was using my phone instead of studying, now the news article was just a general news article that didn’t have anything bad in it, but I didn’t have enough time to force quit the app, so I just switched it off and threw it on the bed, and got back to work.
My mom walks in and this is where the fuck up begins. She walks in and sees my phone, unaware I was using it and just takes it, saying “when you’re studying, study without distractions”
Fair enough but then I realise that on my iPhone if you don’t pause a video and then close the app, it’ll still show up on the Lock Screen with the title of the website. Which in this case was “Salma Hayek cries during sex scene”
My mom doesn’t open my phone and starts to head into the other room, just as I remember this vital piece of information. So I jump out of my chair and say “Can you PLEASE let me see my phone for ONE SECOND! I need to do something real quick” she said no and to come and take it when my class finishes.
As she’s leaving she switches on my phone to put it on airplane mode and sees the title of the video “Salma Hayek cries during sex scene” and glances a look at me, then leaves the room and lets me study, leaving me in a state of mental turmoil for the next twenty minutes. 
Now I’m too scared to go anywhere near her and am typing this from my brother’s phone, who is currently sleeping.

1889,l425uz,2021-01-24 16:08:08,teenagers,REPOST other one got deleted. Entire class watched me jerk off dick and all in online class from a light glitch.," Light glitch on my camera. Well I'm in high school turning 15 (I am a male) next week, and yeah. Also I get horny as I'm sure many of you do. I'm chilling in my online math class, and I suddenly get the urge to jerk one. So I decided to turn off my camera or so I naively thought. This teacher was in her mid 50's old teacher, and she didn't know how to work the google meets well. Here is the part where I massively fucked up. Usually when my camera is on there is a bright small light coming out from my computer. When I ""turned off my camera"" that light went off. I usually double check to make sure. I was sitting in my bed which is by the wall, and there I put on some headphones and listened to some sweet porn. I whip my dick out, and start beating it after a little while I finish up naively thinking everything was alright. After class ended I got spammed from a friend of mine in the class that the entire class watched me jerk off dick and all. He said that ""dude your so fucked, you fucking idiot how the hell did you not know that your camera was on"" ""I said no, no, you didn't it the light was off no way, everyone saw me. Then he showed me the video which he took to me beating my meat in front of the entire class. I naively thought that just because the light was off my camera was off. I think what happened was that I miskicked and thought I turned off my camera when I didn't. I proceeded to skip the rest of class, and sit in my room thinking about what i'm going to do when I go back to school on Monday. (I have a hybrid schedule 2 days in person 3 days online. Apparently I also heard that the teacher tried turning off my camera, but due to her being old and not so great with tech she had no idea how. So everyone watched me jerk off dick and all in online class. What do I do?",9,1,lmacool

I also know it sucks that were missing out on all a lot of other things....

But subjectively speaking, when it comes to online classes itself, they are a lot easier for me, basically because I do not have to attend (compared to in-person when I was forced to attend weekly for almost every class). This alone helped me manage my time way better. Most of my classes were asynchourous, and I also took two extra classes this semester compared to what I am used too- and still found it easier to manage compared to the usual.  

If there was one thing I noticed is that due dates in almost all of my courses were flexible  which also made it a lot easier for me. There might of been more work but it felt like with in person classes it was more about your ""performance"" when this semester it was really, atleast for me keeping up with the work.

2440,k8twid,2020-12-08 00:57:52,teenagers,Who's failing online classes due to a lack of motivation because I am.,"Online school is the worst thing for people like me. I'm a freshman in high school and I am failing almost all of my classes due to my laziness but also my school's bullshit. I've never had a C in my grades since 3rd grade but the first quarter of this school year was when I got my first C in Spanish. I'm in I.B. (International Baccalaureate) which is a program in my school that gives the hardest classes in the school. I am also a major procrastinator. But despite being a procrastinator I've always done good in school because when I was face to face I couldn't skip class so I had to do my work. But in online school you let people like me tune out teachers, tab out of assignments and ignore them, and even cheat on tests. When we learn online and do all of our tests online anyone can take their phone or just open a tab on their computer and look up all the answers for the tests. So what's the point of attending class if everything I learn there is practically useless. But these are unsympathetic reasons as to why its not my fault that I'm failing but it's not all my fault because I was unable to do work for a whole week. That's because I needed a new computer and so I had to wait for a new one to ship in. But I had trouble with that so I missed one week of online school because of things I couldn't control. But the school didn't give a rat's ass about that so I had to make up everything I missed that week. So not only do I have to do any new assignments and tests that pop up but I also have to make up a week's worth of assignments. And I.B. from what I've heard takes up all of your time with homework usually when you are face to face. Add in a week's worth of assignments and my laziness online I am basically fucked.",9,1,Belokonev0527

This actually did unfortunately happen this morning. I’m (M20) a college senior taking online classes this semester and I get extremely bored in these classes, especially on tuesdays. On tuesdays I have 4 classes that are 1 hour and 15 minutes each so it’s definitely a long day. To help me through the day I enjoy playing madden while I’m in class. Madden doesn’t require that much attention so I’m still able to listen and take notes on lecture. Today during my madden morning class routine, I got a touchdown scored on me which I instinctively, softly said “aww fuck” to. Then all of a sudden my profesor asked “I think someone’s mic is on, do they have a question?” which is when I realized that I softly said “aww fuck” to a class of 35 people. And because I said it softly, not aggressively, it definitely sounded like a sexual “aww fuck” which is 10x worse. Now my class probably thinks I enjoy partaking in sexual activities during class instead of taking notes like a good boy. Fml. 

TL;DR I was playing madden while in my online class and said softly said “aww fuck” when I got scored on with on with my mic accidentally on, and In retrospect it definitely sounded like a sexual “aww fuck”.",9,1,Thelurkermotive

Someone was next to the video speaker &amp; their loud breathing broke me. Every few seconds or so a loud deep breath would roar out of my speaker, and you can see me visibly loose it on the video. So I stopped and refuse to try it again.

3785,iij4er,2020-08-29 00:41:40,teenagers,A message to everyone starting online classes:,"Stay off your phone during Zoom calls.

I know it’s really easy to just scroll through reddit or something when shit gets boring, but try your best not to.

Most of the time it’s pretty obvious what you’re doing. Your teacher can tell when your face is glowing blue, you’re staring into your lap, or you’re staring mindlessly ahead with your phone in front of the computer screen.

Teachers are so under appreciated and they’ve done so much work to help you get as much out of e-learning as possible. The least you can do is to put your phone away and pay attention (plus it’ll also really help you and your grade in the long run).

I was in a class today where like 80% of the kids were really obviously on their phones, and my poor teacher was so sweet and was just trying to teach us the lesson she planned :(

Anyway, it’s really up to you what you choose to do, but please try to be at least a little respectful to everyone in the class including yourself &lt;3",9,1,roseperils

Just wanted to ask about how instructors are handling waitlisted classes this semester. I got dropped from my waitlisted class by Enrollment (position # 3), and if this were a normal semester, I could easily crash the class and get in with an add code from the instructor. With everything being online however, I'm a bit more anxious on how I would get in to my class. 

I emailed the instructor about a week ago telling them that I'm still interested in taking their class, however they never responded to that. I've taken this professor before and they're pretty notorious with being bad with emails, so I'm not -too- worried, but I'm just curious if there's some sort of procedure set up by the university to make it easier for students to get into the classes they're waitlisted in? I'll probably email the professor again first thing on Monday, but would like to hear how everyone else is doing with their waitlists and classes.

Thanks!",9,1,JonJern
3967,i8neds,2020-08-12 22:08:25,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not taking online classes my mom paid for?,"I (f15) am a dancer, I started taking dance classes at 12, it was fun until October 2019 my parents and I moved so we could live in my grandma's ranch so we'd be a step closer to living in the states. In about late March maybe April I got recommended a dance video from a channel I haven't seen before, I checked it out and loved it, then I found out they had a website where they teach the choreographies they posted on YouTube. I decided to show my mom (f57) the website but made it clear I wanted to try it after we got to the states as we were having money issues and I knew food was more important and also because our house in the states is more spacious and it'd be more comfortable to dance there. Mid April, my mom wakes me up with her laptop in her hand and starts asking me questions, I was half asleep so I just complied because I wanted to be alone, after she was done she left, couple of days later she tells me she paid for the classes, she put her laptop in front of me and told me to figure out how it works then left the room, I realized the questions she was asking me were for the website and I got annoyed.

It wasn't going too well, in the area we live in the wifi is limited so if too many people use it, it will slow down, and I wasn't fully comfortable dancing as there was furniture around me and I was afraid of hitting something, and also because I felt uneasy at the thought of someone walking past and seeing me through the windows so I closed them causing the room to get warmer. One day my mom noticed the room always being warmer after classes and because it's hot during the day she didn't appreciate it much, I explained and she immediately nagged ""you went to a class full of people that could see you, people that walked passed the classroom could see you too because the doors were wide open so why are you afraid of being seen here?"" because I was so taken back by her sudden burst about how dramatic I am for faking anxiety I couldn't think of the reason because I was scared and immediately wanted the yelling to end so it was left at that, but now I can say it was because at the classes I know it's a public class and that people are gonna see me so I felt fine, but the thought of people seeing me dancing in the safety of my home creeped me out.

Because of my mom's comments it discouraged me from continuing my classes as I felt like she belittled me, so I just stopped, she pestered me to continue because she paid a lot of money but I simply said I didn't feel motivated, which she nagged about as well saying I have no reason to be unmotivated. ",9,1,bunnyboibus

4079,hygdnz,2020-07-26 22:37:42,college,"Is this how online classes are typically run? Teacher seems to be missing virtually all the time, doesn't teach, lecture, give feedback, grade (it's done by computer), administer exams (it's on your own).","# 

Genuine question: Is this how online classes are typically run? I'm attending a community college.

This is the second teacher who doesn't appear to find time to teach, grade anything until the very final days, provide even a word of feedback, hold office hours to discuss, or even respond to emails at the community college I go to.

The first one went AWOL, then wrote a long note about his main business was going under because of the coronavirus shutdown and that he'd respond personally at the end of the semester and get his act together, but we never heard from him again. We all had C-s or Ds in the class because he failed to grade assignments that we spent so much time on and eventually some assignments closed out with zeros as assigned scores. He did fix the grading by just giving everyone full credit literally one second then a couple seconds later then a couple seconds later one day a few days before the very end of the semester—since we can set up alert notifications when an assignment is graded—but never sent any follow up emails as he promised. He never responded to our emails either. Is this proper?

This second professor teaches around four or five online classes, which is admittedly a lot. We are to read a few chapters out of the online textbook each week, write and post a short essay to the discussion board online, read and respond to two other classmates' short essays, take an online multiple choice test each week which processes your score immediately online through the system. Everything is all on the online system. She said she doesn't respond to emails except all at once each Friday and even then may not get back unless there is a need in her view. No office hours either. No face to face anything and zero opportunity for that. We don't get lectures, slides, any feedback at all--not even one word or ""This needs improvement"". The tests are on your own and you click on it when you're ready to start. What is she doing in service of her profession? That’s a sincere question. She told a classmate she gets paid over $100,000 for teaching fall, summer, and spring several online classes each semester.

I know teaching is a hard profession. I take the time to get to know my teachers, help out with classmates, and attend office hours when they're held so I can really get the concepts and more. It's time I really treasure. But this seems out of the usual lines with what teachers are expected to normally do, whether online or not. 

According to public salaries posted online, most of my community college professors earn $20K-$40K for teaching 1-2 classes. She teaches around 5-6, which is admittedly alot, and she earns $110K plus claims $30K in overtime, and with benefits added on it's $170K but I don't think the salary counts the last part. So she's earning $140K for not ""teaching"" or interacting at all with students. I live in a high cost state for what it's worth (think CA, NY, along those lines, etc.) where jobs can pay over $100K if you're in the right job.

I'm just wondering about these couple teachers since is this style of teaching is more prevalent than I thought? Should anyone say anything?",9,1,worklife2018

I have historically failed EVERY single online class I have ever taken. How do I not do this? What have others found to work? I struggle sitting down to watch recorded lectures. Making time to do things that aren't physical attendance based is difficult. I tend to ignore or totally miss my alarms. Homework doesn't have the same meaning to me when I don't see the look of disappointment on a prof's face when I don't have the work done, or the pressure of watching everyone else turn it in complete.

4184,hn2ou2,2020-07-07 20:43:42,rutgers,yet another pointless rant about the format of online classes,"I understand that transition to online classes is hard on all of us but ever since we transitioned online, I’ve noticed that I’m more motivated to study for classes in which professors present the material in a more organized manner. 

I had professor Solimon for genetics during summer one and I have NO interest in genetics at all but I was able to do well in the class because of how well she organized the material. She had an in depth weekly agenda on canvas and color coded each type of assignment that had to be completed by the end of the week. She also uploaded all her lectures, recitations, and office hours so you didn’t have to attend lecture at the allotted time (this was EXTREMELY helpful as I haven’t been able to get my ADHD meds ever since I moved home). Though attending lecture / recitation / office hours at the specified time wasn’t mandatory, this didn’t encourage slacking as everything had to be completed by the end of the week and it’s hard to finish them all last second. So instead of being forced to attend lectures when it was hard for me to concentrate, I could take it at my own speed and spend an hour each day when I was in the right mind to study and get them done. 

I’m currently taking another class rn for summer 2 and the professor is using 4 different online platforms, 1 for lectures, 1 for quizzes, 1 one for another type of quiz, and another one for exams. The mandatory lectures, recitation, office hours, are scheduled back to back and I’m forced to sit at my computer from 12:30-6:30 (if I want to make use of all the help presented to me). It’s only been 2 days and I’m already super lost and extremely stressed and don’t know where to access course materials or the assignments / quizzes due each week. Not to mention, sitting at my computer for 6 hours listening to someone teach leaves me with little energy to study by myself and practice the material later in the day. 

My point is, I feel like professors who take the time to really organize their notes make it a better learning environment for students. The least that can be done is making the notes more clear and present them well bc we don’t have the same resources we would have on campus. rn we’re paying $7000 just to watch YouTube videos. 

TLDR: professors who organize their material and use one platform encourage learning

4635,gi0kfh,2020-05-12 00:51:38,Professors,Just taught my final online class for the semester. Had the best attendance I've had in weeks. Ended with smiles and applause. Wow.,"I don't know what it was, maybe something in the air...but I had two or three more students show up than I have in the past four or five weeks. 

Nothing special, went over some stuff from the previous week, explained to them the college's decision regarding the pass-fail grading option, talked a little bit about the essay I had just collected, and about the essay I was assigning in lieu of final exam. 

Then we had a continuation of our ongoing ""Netflix party,"" as we watched most of the rest of the documentary that was to be the inspiration for their final essay (chat feature on througout).

Class ran from 6 to 7:15 p.m., and they didn't seem to mind when I ran a few minutes long. And when I finally stopped and asked if anybody had any questions about whatever, they kept me busy for another 15 or 20 minutes. Only one person signed off at 7:15 when the class ended, the rest stuck around. I make sure I answered every last question. 

Finally, I said, well, this has been a strange semester, but it's been kind of fun. Don't think you're done with me just yet, I fully expect each of you to work your asses off for the next 6 or 7 days on this essay, etc... and then I wound it down, thanked everybody, and asked one more ""anything else?"" There was not, so I said, okay, everybody go get some sleep - it's late! (It was now after 7:40.) They laughed (the ones I could hear/see) and there was a smattering of (what I'd like to believe was appreciative) applause, and everyone signed off one by one. 

A satisfying end. I just hope their essays don't kill the buzz when I check them next week LOL :)",9,5,askingquestionsblog

So due to the current pandemic, as its become fairly obvious, schools have been shut down, and currently to replace physical school, we are having online classes, via zoom. So we started online classes in late March I would have to say. The very first thing that we were emailed along with the schedule is that these meetings were not mandatory, and that it is not required that you show up to them. However, I showed up to each of the meetings, because 1, what else am i going to do, and 2, in the slim chance that we actually learn something useful. This morning however, I had a meeting at 9:30, but over slept, missing 1 meeting, out of the rest of them. I texted some of my friends who I had knew had went cause we hop on discord calls during the meetings and talk and hang out. I had asked them what he had done and whether we actually learned something or not, knowing the answers was most likely no, cause we never did learn anything new and we had to learn everything ourselves. So I had woken up, like 10 minutes after the meeting had ended, and we had done nothing, no big deal I thought. I went to the kitchen to get something to eat. My parents had asked how many meetings I had today, and at what times they were. I told them I had 1 meeting and I missed it, by like 10 minutes. I told them it was no big deal since we hadn't done anything, but they got super pissed and told me I had to email my teacher apologizing for not going to the meeting. But what I did, I know was petty, but I did it anyway, I said no and tried to argue. I argued that I had went to each of the meetings and I missed 1 so it wasn't a big deal and how we had done nothing that day. Throughout the day, whenever they asked if I had done it or not(with a snide tone), which each time I said no, and brought up more reasons as of why it wasn't necessary, and after a while my reasons got cheap cause I was getting irritated, like ""I have gone to each meeting except this one and theres other people who haven't shown up to any.""

Now we are doing online classes, my calculus professor has simply assigned us 13 lessons and a unit test to be completed in 2 weeks time (typically we complete 1 lesson per class period... so we would have had 6 class periods if it weren't online).  I emailed him that I would not be able to complete this.  He said he would email the class this weekend (all the stuff is due tonight at 11:59) yet he hasn't yet.

6036,fk7kvy,2020-03-17 15:54:18,tifu,TIFU by forgetting I was sharing my screen during an online class,"Today is my second day doing online courses at my university due to the Covid-19 quarantine. This morning we had a presentations session for our semestrial projects with two coaches on Microsoft Teams.

They start by asking if everyone was doing okay, we took turns speaking yada yada. I remember that I'm in this class with one of my good buddies whom I immediately begin messaging in the chat section, because, you know, my focus is already faltering.

So, we start with the presentations. I'm touching up my own to make it a bit clearer and eventually it's my friends turn in the spotlight. He manages to not manage and takes forever to share his screen, can't seem to make his mic work properly... the typical Skype call with your grandma. 

I, of course, begin poking at him in the personal chat, sending messages like ""Are you stoned?"", ""Remove your balls from the mic before speaking into it..."" and other such nonsense. I can hear him struggling not to laugh as I'm cackling over my own muted mic.

His presentation ends, and we go for a ten minute break, during which we exchange a couple messages of the ""Damn, this session sucks..."" and ""Stop jerking off to Premium Pornhub"" sort.

So here is where the fuckup actually happens. You're probably guessing already.

As we join back into the call after the break, I'm called upon to start my presentation. I oblige, and run through my slides. At the end, the coaches go over a couple questions, and end by asking if my fellow students have remarks of their own. Of course, everyone's mic is muted... astounding silence. I Alt+Tab from Powerpoint to Teams and go to the chat session. I send my buddy a ""Welp... this is awkward"" and wait for an answer. 

A couple seconds later, one of the coaches clears his throat and says:

""Uuuh Lipschitzle, you know you're broadcasting your chat right now?""

Sure enough, I see that beautiful red outline around my screen, framing the vile collection of  prepubescent banter that is my chat.

I don't think I have ever Alt+Tabbed the fuck out of somewhere that fast before. I think I died of shame on the spot. I do believe I managed a Poker-voice ""Yes, sorry"", but I was shitting myself.

One of the coaches was clearly trying to contain his laughter but the other was not impressed. 

To make matter worse, once I managed to stop screen sharing, I start nervously laughing and panting only to realize I hadn't yet muted my microphone. I learned later that my buddy had fallen asleep behind his computer in his bed at the break, and thus didn't reap my juicy karma slap. 

Be careful mates, it could have been MUCH worse, don't let this shit happen to you.

He took away one of the biggest perks of online classes imo. I'm sure some students are still going to zone out at times and miss a bunch of material because we're not face-to-face.

&amp;#x200B;

 It's also an art class, so it's not like there's practice problems or homework assignments that I can review before exams. Instead I just have lecture slides with pictures of the artwork,dates, who made it, etc. The professor lives in another state, so the only office hours he has is online as well.

&amp;#x200B;

It doesn't help that I suck at taking notes for live lectures because I was home-schooled. I learn and retain so much more if I can pause the lecture to take notes and then resume. The only way to view a recording is if you miss class and have an excused absence. I got that once and it was so much nicer than frantically scribbling down notes as fast as possible.",8,1,romancatholic45

I read his SET comments and his students really enjoyed his classes and how he conducted them. His SET score is, in UP grade, about near flat uno. 

Majority commended him for his timely upload of recorded lectures, his option to make activities individual or by pair or group, for his timely feedback of assessments, his availability for consultations, and for conducting enough synchronous classes and uploading the recorded synch classes for students’ perusal. Also the way he teaches in general since he still makes jokes and makes the class lighter. 

I just want to make a post to thank everyone (students and faculty alike) who helped us transition smoothly with online classes. He still had a few negative comments but mostly technical difficulties and yung mahirap niyang exam HAHA 

All in all, I’m happy his students appreciated his effort in making their classes enjoyable, kahit GEs or majors.

I personally have a pretty shitty laptop with bad connection so sometimes the teacher can't understand what I am saying, and two times now has it just refused to work properly during an exam and due to it I can't finish and then I get a low grade because teachers assume I am faling it so I can get out of doing it for the day.

1450,m2dizt,2021-03-11 00:34:09,teenagers,"how to focus during online class, and catch up with a shit ton of homework","i had to make a whole new account just for this, so strap in because this is gonna be a mess.

(update: that account had low karma so i guess I'll have to deal with it and post in on main... here we go)

today my maths teacher sent a reminder in our class groupchat about how the kids who didn't turn in their online homework will get in big trouble, and there's a lot of details so let me just keep this short.

since 7th grade, I hadn't been focusing in my classes. history, maths, you name it. 

tw / self harm

ever since my maths teacher outed (is that the right word????) me on my self harming habits (?) i kinda lost all motivation. it's a VERY long story, so I'll keep this one short too.

i started self harming at 7th grade, mostly because i saw people on twitter do it and i was curious as to why they found it satisfactory, or whatever you're gonna call it and i tried it and oh boy did that last since today.

so the counselor, my maths teacher (who is also my homeroom teacher) kinda... traumatized me or something, it's hard to describe. i guess something snapped in me when the counselor forced me to show my cuts when i was obviously being uncomfortable and was literally crying at the time too. jesus christ, those are the wild times.

anyways, ever since that, i started hating everyone at school, the teachers, heck even all the students and i thought that they're all just pretentious fucks. I didn't have any motivation to pay ANY attention to class, and i used to be one of the top students in terms of grades, so hitting a wall was really hard on me.

and not to mention, my mom even found out about it which is also a long story and i unfortunately am too lazy to explain, so let's just leave it at that. so i guess i got pretty traumatized that the shock made me stop self harming daily, key word is daily here. i still do it when i want a quick happy pill when i truly do hit a wall again.

( self harm warning ends here. )

anyways, i guess i’m a maladaptive daydreamer too, but that's a whole other story. I'll probably make a separate post for that later i guess. 

if you know the game omori, then it's just like that. i ran away from my problems by daydreaming and ignoring this whole situation I'm in.

are you getting confused? is this all too much to take in? oh well baby this is just the beginning. you brought it upon yourself when i told you this would be a mess. 

anyways, (2) in order to cope with all this, i, as a horny teenager, masturbate. well that's it that's the post.

whenever i felt sad or anything i didn't even deal with it and i just.... fap.... i guess...? and i guess that's dealing some damage to my academics. I didn't want to do my homework, I didn't wanna do anything, i just cared about fapping. I'm horny all the time. 

tl;dr im just a sexually pent up teenager with some mental issues who is struggling with grades and understanding stuff at school because I'm just that horny. send help.",8,1,ch4nlix

And one of the problems that got brought up was how people in the lgbtq community aren't treated fairly or even as people sometimes, and apparently in this class there are some students who are very much christians. and you can probably guess where that went. they were in the class trying to justify it and saying that its just their belief that homosexuality is a sin and they are going to hell, and also the bullshit cop out of 'we all struggle with sin'. To which I say bullshit. your sexuality isn't something you can control, it's just the way you are. It's like saying being a certain race is a sin or something. And this hits me especially as I am a part of the lgbtq community, being asexual (and they surprisingly didn't have anything to say about that). I don't want to start anything, but I'm just going to say it - this is one of the reasons I am an atheist.

When I tell her to quiet down, she whines and goes to our parents, and I usually get yelled at by them. She had one of her classes during my lunch break, and while I was making lunch, I dropped something. It was really loud, and she started to yell at me. I tried to do it quieter, but she still got mad at me. I was annoyed, so I sit down next to her and chew with my mouth open. Later that day, when I was on my class, I heard her watching TV loudly, like she usually does, and when I told her to turn it off, she didn't even respond. The next day, she had school off, and watched TV at full volume the entire time, and it was really hard for me to concentrate (i have adhd, so its really hard to work with the tv blaring), and I wound up failing a test. The day after that, when she was on her class, I did the same thing to show her how it felt, and played video games all day with the volume turned up loud. She yelled at me, saying that she couldn't concentrate at all, and now my parents revoked my TV and video game privileges, while she got off scot free. AITA?",8,1,AssQueso

I need to take Engineering 361 in order to graduate and I tried to get into the class asap last semester because I know the computer science dept has had a ton of problems with getting students into that class. I was apparently too late to get into the first sections they made, even though I contacted my counselor about the class before registration, but I was told they were adding more sections. When the new section was added and I was given permission to enroll, the new section had a time conflict with another major class I was taking so I couldn't enroll in that section and the only section that worked with my time conflicts was section 4. I emailed my counselor about this and even pointed out the on mycsulb the course is labeled as having seats open, but he didn't respond to me. Eventually I figured out my counselor was not going to be able to help me so I emailed the cs dept chair but still wasn't able to get a response from them either. Over the summer I gave up and decided to wait until the class schedule is updated with the professor's name so I could contact them directly to try and add the class, but the class still doesn't have a professor listed, but still shows open seats available. 

TLDR: The only section of Engineering 361 that works for me is section 4, which has open seats available. But I need dept consent and no one has responded to my emails and there's no professor listed for me to contact

Mainly I'm just checking if anyone has any tips for dealing with this, or is enrolled in section 4 of engr 361 and knows who the professor is",8,1,WHellhaus

1. Live on campus
2. Take the hybrid class next semester (if things are even normal by then or if theres more hybrid/in person classes offered then) and take an online class in place of it this semester, and live at home
3. Defer

I know nobody can predict the future, but I was hoping some upperclassmen who experienced online learning last semester could tell me what it’s like so I can figure out what would be best for me.

Most people can agree that there is a significant difference between in-person lectures and online, pre-recorded or zoom, lectures. People who choose online classes won't have the same amount of resources as people who choose to go in-person. When I say ""the same amount of resources,"" I'm talking about how it may be disadvantageous for students taking the course b/c professors decided to wait a couple of days to respond to your messages. I also saw that Towson students don't have to come back after Thanksgiving break, but wtf is that going to do? They will be in school for about 2-3 months already. So all I'm saying is that the quality of the education and content is not going to be ""equal"" because of the in-person or online choice. Obviously, the main reason why students choose online classes is that they don't want to catch the virus and spread it to their family or friends.

My teacher was making us take small quizzes on the regions of africa, and I was curious and asked if we would have a quiz on the whole continent of Africa. She said yes we would and basically me along with the rest of my class moaned in disbelief. Here’s where the story gets interesting.. This female then blames me for us getting a quiz on africa. Now, this wouldn’t have been such a big deal if she just said that, but there had been some tension leading up to this point. I swear to god every single time we were in class she would say to the entire class “YO Extrqgaming YOU LOOKIN LIKE A YOUTUBER WHEN YO NEXT VIDEO COMING OUT” and you might be wondering why she said this and it’s because i was using my gaming setup for online classes and yes I am a serious gamer with headphones a microphone stand the whole shebang. So after a while of this I was getting extremely agitated by her because it was annoying. I kid you not, the beginning of EVERY SINGLE CLASS she would say this. So that’s all the backstory you need for what’s about to happen. She blamed me for all of us having to take the africa quiz. I was in a discord call with my friend because you know class is to boring to not be talking to your friend for the whole period so we were talking and then she said that. I went to go mute my microphone but the wind pulled my hand away at the last minute and i didn’t click the mute button,Or I just forgot to mute myself but i like the other way better, and proceeded to call her a b**ch. In front of everyone. In my online class. Including my teacher. At first my friend just laughed but after I heard a very stern voice say “Excuse me Extrqgaming?” I knew I had messed the frick up. If you saw me then you woulda thought i was a mother freaking tomato it was so embarrassing. So yeah, that’s my story of online classes and remember kids if you gonna talk smack behind someone’s back remember to mute your microphone first.

The professors are ruthless. They don't see our faces, so forget to give us bathroom breaks, or just keep going because they think most of us aren't actually there and we're doing what ever we want anyway.

I just had a class which lasted 5 hours, with one 20 minute break. I'm about to have another 3-hour one in 10 minutes.

I try to move as much as I can when I have free time, but these past weeks I've had exams and deadlines, and I ended up sitting the whole day, nearly every day.

I have an exercise machine at home, but I cannot really use it during class, as they're making us actively participate, so I have to have my hands free in most of the classes. Also, my focus isn't really there when I'm sweating and trying not to die on the machine. 

I know some people can just let the class run in the background on mute, but I am not one of those people. I care about my grades and the impression I leave.

I'm honestly defeated and out of ideas. My mind is so fried from all of the classes, that I can't come up with any solutions right now. Any suggestion will help.

But we all parted our ways and....it's a fresh start for me.... as a college freshman. 

Having said that, this online class setup tested my fear of public speaking and I was shaking and stuttering hard when I was called to answer an easy-peasy question. 

Though I still wanted to answer more, I was quick to turn off my mic and wait for the next slide. 

I want to overcome this but I don't know where to start. I'm an organized person but I can't process my ideas about this. Kindly offer a helping hand, please. 

Thanks, everyone!",7,1,leililila

This is my first semester on campus, I was a transfer last school year in the middle of the pandemic so I have no idea what would be a good place to settle down for that time.

Many times this sem, including now, I just feel lonely and I want some good friends to connect with and talk to. I'd like to meet new people and make friends (maybe even date LOL). It's part of Maslow's Hierarchy of needs, sense of belonging with friends. Thanks to my rampant stupidity and naivety early in life and abysmal social skills, I've got so few friends, damn it. And when I say friends pala, I mean the kind of friends that you'll have a personal connection with. Okay naman yung friend-acquaintance, but the former is what I want/need. I'm in the part of my life where I'd like to make personal connections with people, but sadly it's also the time din where it's most difficult to do so, particularly thanks to the pandemic.

But then, life is so difficult these days that everyone's preoccupied with their own struggles so I guess wala rin saysay in making friends or meeting new people because people would understandably have no time and energy for others.",7,1,Educated_ExMo

2136,kt1opr,2021-01-08 12:39:18,Philippines,The first ever semester of full online class took place last year. How did you guys feel about it?,"I know there's probably got to be an obligatory, ""academic freeze"" statement or anything that says it doesn't work but I would love a discussion and shared experiences. I mean, let's be real we kind of agree that the implementation is bad and it is hard. I'd just like to know in detail.

I am currently a college student taking up engineering. With my experience, it really was mostly self studying with professors teaching through Google Meet. We used Google Classroom for the files and exams. It was difficult. It wasn't like I felt like studying everyday. Sometimes, the examinations are kind of far from what they teach.

I get that they can't just spoon feed and pass everyone. But it's so annoying how most professors seem to feel like we can still do it and learn, how it still feels pretty fair that we get bombarded with lessons and that a pandemic is not really a special case. They make it feel like the pandemic is an inconvenience and our main goal is to study and pass requirements with only our lives and mental health in check as collateral.

It also feels weird how different schools probably have different paces. I've heard University of the Philippines is set to end on January for their semester and start again on March. I've also heard about the obligatory pass in their school, though I wouldn't discredit their experiences as they probably have also a hard time despite the sure pass they would get.

He literally demonstrates what each part needs and provides a walkthrough example-so there is no need to be confused about what to do. When put into breakout rooms, however, my group is absolute crickets literally. They don't respond when I ask them a question, nor do they follow the exact steps the professor demonstrated. At this point of the project, our assignment was to find scholarly articles, copy and paste  the abstract with citations, as well as copy and paste the pictures that are in the document.

Nope, my group members just decide to put a link to the articles into the document and call it a day. An article we can't access using our school's account. It's really frustrating and aggravating when they are not pulling their weight for such a simple task. 

We are all using Wattsapp and have access to the shared Google File. I sent a message today reminding them to send one article by Friday, so that I may submit the assignment by the end of the day. Nobody responded to the message. I'm giving them benefit of the doubt due to the weather messing with their internet or a possible ower outages at their town. Should I try messaging them again tomorrow in the group chat or individually . What should I say so they don't slack off?

With no physical class and Zoom sessions that require class enrollment, obviously students can't just show up and hope to add. How has your institution handled this? And more importantly does it work? What would you change?

We were in a Discord voice channel and she was going around asking every student the same thing, all the while I was thinking about my answer. But all that was popling up in my mind was that I would want to erase myself most of all, and I hated that (I'm diagnosed with depression, so it's not just typical angst). Finally, the teacher asks me. I try to come up with something on the spot, something other than: ""I want to kill myself"" and end up saying something like: ""I would erase nothing. Although I don't know how to elaborate further in Japanese."" She keeps pressuring me (in a supportive kind of way, but still), and eventually says that I should come up with five sentences of elaboration by the end of class and write them down in the text channel.

I mute myself, and start bawling my eyes out. I felt awful. She was so nice about it, letting me take my time, and yet I didn't even try. Some other stuff happened this morning that might have also had a part in me breaking down, but I don't want to get into that.

All the time, people are so nice to me, and I just throw all that kindness into the garbage. I dismiss it, saying I don't deserve it, and end up genuinely believing my words. Worst part? I can't tell anymore whether I'm doing something bad or not, because no matter my actions, I always end up feeling guilty about it. Playing video games? Guilt. Not playing video games? Guilt. Yelling at my brother? Guilt. Yelling at myself? Guilt. It's just this constant cycle of self-deprecation and loathing that I can't escape from, even after 6 months of therapy. My uncle says that maybe I should try antidepressants (he's a therapist, but not my therapist), since nothing seems to be alleviating my symptoms. Am I just so stubborn and proud that I can't change my ways of coping?

Either way, what all of this comes down to is that online class isn't helping anyone. It's stressful and takes up the majoraty of the day with the amount of homework that comes from it. God, I want this whole ordeal to end already.",7,1,TetraBox14

Since all the schools closed, my classes were moved into this program called Zoom where you can enter a code to enter your normal class and video chat with the rest of your classmates as well as your teacher.

One of my good friends is in a different class at the same time as mine and since my class is a blowoff and I don’t even need to pay attention, we came up with a little prank to make things a little funnier. 

He’d give me the code to his online classroom and I’d join and no one would know who I was. 

Enter the code yadda yadda yadda i load into the classroom and everyone has their camera on and the teacher is this old mean “Karen” looking lady who is not familiar with technology. Everyone’s got their camera on and I commence with the plan. I start saying OH YEAHHH FUCK ME DADDY and everyone’s eyes just light up and the teacher is freaking out while my friend is dying. I go on for like 30 seconds just moaning over and over saying the teachers name .... before I hear MY teachers voice saying my name ..... I quickly realize what I’ve done and close both tabs and put my hands over my face ashamed of my actions .....

I was wondering if anyone just has general tips for a smooth course. We use zoom. I’m in the social sciences and was told that it’s expected students will be doing coursework as part of the contact hours. So part of the recommendation is to also make them work on a research project throughout the semester. I’m not sure how to go about this. I had them do critical papers before with mixed success. I teach politics courses and this one will have some legal aspects to it, so I’m thinking of assigning a policy paper. Just not sure how to go about it for the whole semester. Any tips to make class more interactive without overworking myself would be great too. I work another full time job so I don’t want to kill myself either .

6138,ezfvpa,2020-02-05 20:31:29,college,My career requires a degree but the thought of going back to school seems like the worst thing in the world. Tips on how to enjoy school (online classes)?,"I work in Learning &amp; Development (HR) for a large company and I LOVE my job even though I’m at the bottom of the totem pole. I’d really like to pursue a career in this field, or even Career Coaching. However, at a certain point, both roles require a Bachelor’s degree, or even a Master’s degree to get to a certain level. All of the certifications (Clifton Strengths, MBTI, etc.) require degrees to even take the courses, and at a certain point, I’ll need those certifications to move up and not be stuck at the bottom rung forever. 

I’m 27 and have taken two college classes in my entire life (online only), and even when I’m taking a class in something I’m interested in, the work feels like the worst chore ever. Funny considering that I want to work in the learning field, but going to school is nauseating to me. :)

I did really poorly in high school. Every time I *actually* did the work, I would get top of the class grades. But getting me to do homework was practically impossible. I couldn’t focus in class due to extreme boredom and not caring at all about what was being taught, and my grades would plummet because I couldn’t bring myself to do work outside of school, let alone study. 

I’d like to think I’m smart, I actually really love learning new things, but on my own time and things I actually want to learn. If I could get a Bachelor’s from watching Coursera videos all day, I’d do it in a heart beat! 

I work full time, so online classes are the route I’d like to take until I hit a point where I have to show up in person for labs or something. I’m going to do community college and then hope to transfer later on. I just keep pushing it off, or signing up for classes and then dropping them, because the thought of doing multiple classes after work (when my free time is limited already) hurts my heart lol. I completely skipped over the last two semesters because I had vacations planned, and the thought of not being able to take trips over the next few years, or having to do school work during them, also is a deterrent. 

All in all, it’s something I know that I NEED to do (at least for my career path), but I really really really x 10000 don’t want to, and I know I’ll be miserable for the next few years when I actually get it started, so I keep procrastinating.

He has a LOT of knowledge about the topic and seems really enthusiastic about the system he is training us on but between his accent and the usual audio quality issues inherent with online training / webinars, I am having trouble keeping up with the training, the labs we complete as he talks, etc. I have and will continue to try and power through the training listening the best I can though. 

Before our lunch break he mentioned that he wants us to fill out the anonymous day one evaluation survey before we come back from lunch. I did as asked, being honest with the issues I was having with the class but still made sure to praise his knowledge and enthusiasm for the product. Well guess what, it wasn't nearly as anonymous as he said because after we can back from lunch he has been making direct references to the issues I've had. He hasn't said my name specifically but his mood has noticeably soured.

I got stressed 'cause it was really a debate and the guy started laughing at me, so i went to his dm and called hum ""idiot"".

1204,n0wy64,2021-04-29 04:40:35,college,Not sure if I'm doing badly because of online classes or because I'm just a terrible student,"I've been a decent student through high school, with my grades fluctuating depending on how motivated I was and how good my mental health was.

However, during my senior year of high school I suffered from a lot of mental health issues and as a result my grades suffered.


I started my freshman year a few months ago and as such, I have only experienced online college classes.

Depending on the professor and the subject, I can do really well with an online course or really badly, which is also heavily affected by my motivation and mental health.

Today I got a test score back and did really bad (lowest in the class actually) and it's going to be very hard for me to make up for it in future class work. This made me wonder if I really did recover fully from high school or if it's just because online classes brings this out of people.


I don't have any experience because I'm a freshman and I really thought I would be better in college but sometimes I revert back to my old ways(no motivation, anxiety, trouble focusing, bad habits).

Another thing to note is, I know that I have what it takes to get a good grade in these subjects since they aren't extremely difficult. I just don't know if I'm being a lazy, dumb student.

To clarify, this isn't just about my low grade but in general I have been doing badly in some subjects and I'm not sure if it's because I'm just a bad student, if I need to work on my mental health, or if these classes just aren't suited for an online setting.

1963,l0mup2,2021-01-19 16:08:32,college,Conflicted feelings towards online classes,"Hey everyone,

I hope everyone is doing as best as they can through these tough times.

So I’m about to start my second semester of online classes at home. I have a pretty good home life, but I’m getting kind of sick at being at home. My mom is kinda controlling and I feel like I’m not able to be as independent as I want to be. I have sibling who gets to live with her friends in an apartment (some in person classes), and as more time passes by, the more envious I am :(

Here’s the thing though, I don’t really mind online classes. It’s nice have more time outside of class to get shit done and being able to speed through recordings is awesome. I’m also a homebody...

I like spending time with my family, but I think what like more is just having people that I’m comfortable with just being near me, even if we aren’t talking.

I want to go back in person, but at the same time, I don’t. I wish I leaned more one way than the other, but damn, it’s hard.

I don’t have a solid group of friends (I wish I did), but I do have a few really great friends. 

I feel like I’m always pressured to say things like, “I can’t wait to go back on campus” and “I miss dorming” when in reality, I just don’t. 

I don’t really feel lonely at home, which is great. But I don’t want to be stuck here. I know I need to get out and leave once classes go back in person. But the thought of that doesn’t really make me feel excited. 

The pressure of having a bigger social life from people around me stresses the shit out of me, they make me feel abnormal. 

I’m scared for my social life after college (junior now). I love talking to people, but scared of the lack of opportunities. 

I’ve experienced loneliness a couple times in college (when I lived on-campus) and damn, it’s one of the worst feelings, for me at least.

Anyways, if you’ve read this far, thanks and good luck. We will get through this!",6,1,Purple__turtle5737

I was expecting it to be honest but I wasn’t expecting to fail my history course because I kind of love history.  it’s giving me a lot of frustration and anxiety. I knew going into this semester would be brutal but I didn’t expect to fail and if it’s even harder that it’s one of my favorite subjects as well. My parents think I’m lazy despite having an ADHD diagnosis and taking medication for many years. In reality the format of online learning especially in a synchronous classes almost feels impossible for a person with ADHD during this pandemic to hang in there. Usually I would have the sympathy and support of my parents but right now I’m kind of feeling the opposite of that and I’m scared. I want to take a semester off just to wait for some semblance of normalcy to come back into the classroom so I can have the structured classroom environment that I thrived in the the past 19 years of my existence.,6,1,allepic259

Yesterday (Friday) I joined the same teacher’s class, and guess what! She didn’t allow me into the meeting again. After sending messages to my “main teacher” (not sure what it’s called in English) she let me inside the meeting and told me that she marked me ABSENT the first lesson, so I asked her why and she told me that she wouldn’t start a dialog, and I quote, “in this forum.”

About an hour later I sent her 2 paragraphs asking why she did it with VISUAL PROOF. She told me to “stop sending her messages.”

All the students are from my batch of an engineering college and most of them know me. My teacher was just going about her class normally showing presentation, explaining stuff and then it happened.

A dog came out of my house and it was raining so we let it in. We couldn't take him in the house because he was a stary dog and pretty dirty so I had to direct him towards the stairs area which is secluded from the rest of the house. I was attending the class from my phone so I get up with the phone and I don't know how my finger went and unmuted the mic but It was on and I SHOUTED,""come here come here here here hereeee!!! Among certain other things to get the dog to the stairs. All that time I was listening to the lecture, I should for a good 3-4 minutes and teacher went quite after 2 minutes. Think about this without reference some wierdo starts shouting on the mic ""come here come here come hereee"". After that I started getting the messages of doom suggesting my mic was on and I left tha meeting instantaneously because I was shocked I mean how!? The mic was supposed to be OFF, though I joined again after 5-10 minutes. And now I want to put my head below a roller, or punch through my head maybe ahhhhhhhhh dang it! Anyway the class is over now but the embarrassment remains.

Tl;dr: attending an online class with 120 batchmates, all muted except tha teacher.

It's my only class on campus this semester so I hate dropping it, but I'd also like to do well in the class and the reviews my current professor has are terrible (he has a 1.7), the professor for the online class has a 4.5 and seems to be pretty well-liked. 

Should I suck it up and just take the class in person, or should I just take it online? The hybrid meets once a week so it wouldn't be that bad but I'd be stuck with the same instructor for the lecture.",6,1,breeerin
4060,hzxwnh,2020-07-29 09:49:02,college,Professor suspecting online class is cheating,"Ever since my university switched to lecture classes being online, we’ve had to do everything on Blackboard.  Our exams and quizzes are on another program.  Anyway, my bio prof put lecture recordings on Blackboard, as everyone is having time conflicts.  Apparently, on Blackboard, professors can track our access to where we go on it.  Well the entire class got an email of the prof being suspicious of cheating cause there is little to no activity on our course materials, but the grade average on exams are pretty high.  Now, I’m not gonna be the person that defends the rest of my classmates, cause is it likely that someone is just cheating? Yes.  I wouldn’t be surprise, and that’s all I’m gonna say on that.  But the thing is, I never look at my prof’s lecture recordings other than the first two or three because I don’t like the way the prof teaches.  I find their method of explaining the material to be confusing.  So I just write down what the chapters are about and search up videos on YouTube or go on Khan Academy instead and take notes to study from.  Which actually helps me understand the material better, thus I get decent scores on the exams.  But because of the suspected cheating, the prof is gonna start taking attendance grades by grading our past activity on Blackboard in the class (ie if we looked at the lecture recordings and how long we spent on it).  Overall, I’m just worried that these attendance scores will affect my grades in my class since, like I said, I didn’t bother to look at the recordings because I use other resources.",6,1,bluebird151

4263,hebefn,2020-06-23 09:21:50,AmItheAsshole,AITA for missing my online classes?,"Alright, the title may sound a little bit dumb at first but here is some backstory leading to the events that happened.

I (17M) just recently graduated the Spanish equivalent to pre-universitary courses. Two years that will affect if I do or do not enter the university I want. I have attended every single online class that there has been until graduation. However, even if we finished school, I still have some tests outside of school which are like global exams to test what we learned over the course of these two years.

Now, I have had a horrible teacher (M) that would always enter class and be a douchebag for the entire hour: being very egocentrical, getting mad over the smallest things and stuff like being mean to classmates. Despite that, he did kind of like me or just did not hate me because I got high grades. Even if the feeling of bonding was not mutual, I played it off as if we were cool and whatnot.

Fast forward until last Friday. He appointed a meeting to have an online class at 11:30 but I did not attend it for two reasons: I was out handing over some information and making a payment at my school to apply for these exams I told you about; and I thought, having already finished the course, that it'd be a class to solve students' questions and, therefore, attendance would be voluntary. Well, turns out attendance was mandatory.

The teacher in question sent an angry email to all students who did not show up to that class as well as their parents (around 19/25 students did not show up to his class) and I just noticed this all on Sunday. His note said that he begged those who had not attended the first class not to attend any other classes since it had been offensive from us not to show up.

Yesterday morning there was another class and, following his orders, I did not even try to join the call even if I was home and completely available. Turns out he did want us to join because he then went ahead as to write yet another note to us, asking why we did not show up today either. I got confused but did not really care about it. Same cannot be said about my parents though.

When my parents saw the note in the evening they went furious and made me write an apology email to the teacher, taking his side immediately without really listening to what I had said. Needless to say, the teacher kept his ego before anyone and wrote back a good paragraph basically telling me I was very wrong in thinking his work was voluntary and that me not attending his lessons was unreasonable even if I did tell him why I just couldn't have attended.

So, Reddit, am I really the AH in this situation?",6,1,yaboiaspect

4950,g7zsyi,2020-04-25 19:35:44,teenagers,Alright! My opinions about these online class platforms.,"Google Classroom - 4 stars out of 5

We all know Google! It’s been used internationally, and it’s the number one source of information we go to wether we need to search for something. Now, I understand
that most people may not have such great opinions about this... but as a Classroom user, I gotta day that it’s great! It is designed for schools! It’s designed for education! What if we used Classroom for something else? Don’t mind if I do. I get that Classroom might be uncommon... we all use different platforms, but a platform that is designed for the education system, I’d say that it’s my number one go to.

Discord - 5 stars out of 5

Discord! The platform we all want to use, and sometimes we all wish that we could have a Discord server for everyone. But alas, I can guarantee you! No boomer have been able to figure out Discord on their own! Discord is jus full of these millennials and the Gen Z’s. If I would have given the opportunity to use Discord, I would not mind. But, since there is work to do, documents, slides, and such... I’d say that if we were to use Discord, then we would optimise to save files on our computers rather than writing Google Documents over and over again. It’s just something we are not used to completely, but will get used too soon.

Zoom - 1 star out of 5

What the fuck is Zoom?!? Literally! What the hell is that? It’s not secured, it’s not protected, and it’s full of hackers. I have seen one, if not a half dozen of stories regarding Zoom. Zoom has been banned in certain nations worldwide because of the hackers. And it’s stupid. Thereafter, I’d say use Google instead! You can make your own, or you can ask your teacher to make the Google account for you. I know that there’s a certain age for a Google account... but, what’s better than a platform where guys can randomly join in and scream racial slurs and show pornography in front of a class of 30 children? It’s just all about the boomers though, and sometimes I just don’t get why they chose to just use that. 

My opinion, though. You can share your opinion and then I might agree.",6,6,speed_fighter

i withdrew from my other class too. no intentions of retaking that one online or offline tho, it was just absolute garbage. i tried so hard to make online classes work for me because theoretically it would fit in so much better with my work schedule, but i can’t. and it sucks.

For **small** low-stakes assignments (like discussion posts, reflections, ""homework"", etc.) which professor/instructor would you prefer? 

**Professor A**

Provides both a numerical score on every item and always includes a written comment. Written comments are usually pretty generic (and if you compared with your peers in the class, you'd see it was a lot of copy/paste).

**Professor B**

Provides a numerical score on every item. Only sometimes writes a comment, but comments are uniquely written for you and your work. So more personalized, but less frequent comments.

I dont know if yall in the us, are used to classes at 7 am, and you may see this as a joke but its so fucking insane to be in your own home at fucking 7 am, like ive tried anything coffee, having a shower at 6 fucking am, sleeping 8 hours, but nothing helps, i just feel so bad when i wake up and have to sit in my fucking computer. 

I dont have a problem on waking up early to actually go to the campus, that's good because you get to see your pals and shit, but being alone at home, listening to class that no ones wants to take because they're fucking sleeping, oh and that's another thing, everyone is asleep, expect a few of us, so it feels so unfair. I just want it to be over but the semester still have 3 fucking months left.

I m an introvert but I find myself being able to easily make friends back at when physical classes were happening at school. i plan to apply for masters later so I well would need a prof rec letter which means professors should at least know/remember me. and trust me those moments in online classes at school when I was the solo person speaking kinda makes me very nervous as it feels like a spotlight was on me?

For now, online classes are said to take place for 4 months straight. oh and did I mention the college is in a different country and I would probably be one of few students who are not part of locals?

I should preface by saying I was a machinist most of my life so I am not computer savvy.

Class begins and my camera is pointed at my neck (its a laptop and camera is at bottom of screen) so I tilt laptop up. The touch thing on the screen closes the class window. I open it back up and apologize, no one can hear me because I'm muted. I turn mute off, apologize and the professor begins talking. A few minutes pass and my internet or something is slow because her speech is garbled. I ask her to repeat herself, she does. Few minutes go by, I tilt the screen because it's hard to see the text were looking at now and I forget about the touchscreen and it closes the window. 

Rinse and repeat, more or less. It's not like this every class but the speech thing is a nightmare. I am worried it is my hearing, but could be the internet because everyone else seems to have no issue. This is a pretty typical class though. Those things on top of not being an academic and being out of school for a long time can really wreak havoc on my focus during the class. It's also a little embarrassing too, if I'm being honest haha

The online classes are impossible because I have really severe anxiety and just feel ike I'm drowning. I failed 2 classes last semester. I can't do a class if I can't even talk to the professor(besides email). I got really bad panic attacks and just want to go back to a classroom.

I also had to move during the pandemic because my abusive family found my address and were coming to my house. Tried to get a restraining order but it was denied.

Extreme anxiety and depression + awful family + pandemic and no support for students

I have no idea how to get a job. I wasn't able to do any networking or anything before the lockdown. And it seems like the few open jobs are really competitive because so many places are shut down.

I was a communications major but now I'm just a dropout because the pandemic and my inability to do classes online. I wasted 3 years of my life and have no future",5,1,non_toxic_tide_pods

Given the pandemic all my classes are online which sucks because with all the distractions of daily life I feel like I won’t be able to focus and get my work done, plus the constant inevitable annoyance of forgetting deadlines, discussion posts etc. Once I even forgot to take a whole unit exam, though my professor was nice enough to let me retake it at no penalty.

Im kinda happy being at home, not only cause there are plenty of works so it helps. But the main reason is cause the people(we´re about 10 people) of my shift are not exactly my type. We always spend recess and lunch break together, and i realized that they are so social, always talking. But it´s really annoying cause they like to laugh at ridiculous stuff. I´m a very introvertid girl so im the only quiet person there. It is so uncomfortable to just be there while they are having a great time. The boys are cooler than the girls, and sometimes make conversation with me while the girls usually just talk about whatever. I can talk 1v1, but when they are all in just a big group i can´t talk, and i hate it. At least, in online classes i don´t have to talk to them.  So i really enjoy online college.

I thought this would be easier, but I am having  a horrible time. Also I have been out of school for several years, so I'm a little out of practice when it comes to studying anyway. 

My abnormal psychology class is especially difficult (it's my first 200 level course). There are no lectures, so I've been trying to take notes out of the book, but I don't even know what to take notes over...every line seems important. It's taking me several hours to get through a single chapter and by the time I'm done, I can't even remember what I just read. I have also tried reading and highlighting the chapter and then going back later to take notes on what I highlighted, but it is so painstakingly boring that I abandon taking notes halfway through.

I have my unit 1 test tomorrow and I'm panicking. There's so much information and I don't know what is important. I've googled it so many times and every site says to go through the textbook and look for overall themes, but that's not enough for this class.

3239,j4hj63,2020-10-03 16:03:07,Philippines,lemme share something about online class,"I know the topic is barely relevant anymore but I really just want to get this off my chest.

I have been attending online classes for almost a month now. But one month isn't enough for the rest of us to adjust. I appreciate the efforts of our prof to get their lessons across, but there's **this** one prof that we all have. The worse part, is that she teaches math.

I was in her zoom call on the entire duration, I didn't get disconnected, didn't get kicked out for no reason (unlike what my other blockmates told me), so I was able to hear everything that she said.

* She doesn't like getting late attendees because for her, admitting students into her zoom call was a hassle. This one is pretty understandable.
* She emphasizes that we are students so we should be always early. I get her still, but not all students have good internet connection nor the entire day to devote to online class.
* This is when her argument started to become unreasonable. She says that it's our problem if we couldn't enter her class. She said that it's not her problem because her job is to teach within the time allotted in her schedule. 

I know, we're old, we're college freshmen, we're supposed to be responsible and able to adapt. I get that. ~~This entire post is whiney af already~~ We have no control over our internet connection. I honestly don't get the right to complain because I have what I need, but, wow. This is a threateningly low level of cooperation. 

So the following day in our NSTP class, our prof asked how online learning was for us. One of my block mates who got disconnected and was not admitted back to the call said this:

""Having a difficulty in understanding some of the lesson most especially; whenever the instructor in a particular subject often goes choppy in the virtual class. Anyway, if they got mad because of you getting disconnected from the class, for me it is okay. i know at the end of the day it all goes down to 'answer your module'""

tl;dr: terror profs in online classes are twice the terror",5,1,igotstolenagain

We were in an online class, math, to be specific, and our teacher has a cool routine ""challenge Friday"" where some of us step into the board and compare answers

Since obviously we arent having classes IRL, We are looking at our teacher's shared content, and we do a race on who can answer first. I liked it at first, but over the months, I hate it.

Surprisingly, today I got the answer right (the only answer I got right in the whole ass class) and answered first. When we were comparing answers, my friend (let's call her summer) asked the teacher to not show her answer.

When we were done, I asked her via message if she got it wrong, and yes, she did, the answer was 756 and she got over 1000. She told me she was crying, and I tried to console her, telling her that it was ok to be afraid and everyone makes mistakes

I told her that things like that have also happened to me, and I talked to her because she seemed sad... she took a lot of time to answer, and then told me she was ok, to which I replied I was  there if she needed me 

Looking back, It doesn't seem like I was trying to help, it only feels like I was a weirdo that was trying to approach to here when she was like that

I kinda wish I hadn´t talked to her, but now I will live as the creep that reaches to girls when they are sad",5,1,SpicyFox951

we registered him in the same section of the same online class as me. does anyone know if there is anything against this? or anything that would give us problems? i think the main issue that would come up would be cheating, but it’s an intro to philosophy class so i’m pretty sure it’s your own thoughts anyways and not just a straight forward answer like a math class.

As it so happened, I - who woke up at 1 in the afternoon and had therefore skipped breakfast - felt the need to pass an ungodly amount of gaseous chaos. Now as it so happened, the time picked by my sphincter to let it RIIIP coincided with my movement towards the dining table. Her microphone was on. 

The entire class heard it and thought it was my sister who did it (they were able to identify it because everyone else was silent, I guess?). And no they didn't believe her even when she insisted it wasn't her.

 Yuuuuuuuuuup. 

Do I feel guilty? Maybe. 

Am I going to try it again? Maybe.


Anyway, so the mod considers this too short. So here's a nice little poem about flatulence:

they're good for your heart.

The more you eat,

the more you fa*t.

The more you fa*t,

the better you feel.

So have those beans with every meal.

4182,hn6nba,2020-07-08 00:24:05,tifu,TIFU by angrily starting an online class.,"This is a sequence of fuck-ups. 
Today was being a very good day - I did some gymnastics and got that serotonin high, had my house chores done early in the morning, ~Bolsonaro got diagnosed with COVID 19~ , spent the day on a video call with my gf and playing The Sims.
I (18F) am an English teacher and in my school, we've just started online classes. I put a lot of pressure on my work bc I'm the newest teacher in the team and I have fewer classes compared to other teachers. I've got to make the best I can, otherwise, I'm the first in line to be fired.
So I planned my class for today and right before it (around 6 pm) I got into a very unpleasant conversation with my mom. It's a long story, but she's willing to do something I couldn't disagree more and that puts other people (people we love!) on danger and COVID-19 exposition. I got SO mad. I'm a pretty chill person, and it had been MONTHS since the last time I was so f*cking angry. This alone had already ruined my day.
I took some distance to slow down and try to focus before my class (18:30). It didn't work and I started the meeting controlling myself to be kind to my kids. 
I don't know how exactly it happened, but I must've been very distracted, bc usually I don't even leave cups of water close to my computer. Within 2 minutes of class, I spilled a large amount of water all over it. This was purely a consequence of distraction, I was too mad and spiraling to realize it was there. 
I started screaming, turned the computer off, quickly unplugged the charger as well as calling my dad to help me. 
I immediately texted my boss, explaining what had happened and before I could even type asking for her to cancel the class with my students' parents, she said ""Okay, but can't you just log in with your cellphone?"". I was just like holding my inner anger to not tell her I'M SORRY, MY COMPUTER BEING ALIVE MIGHT BE MY PRIORITY RIGHT NOW. I was polite though.
Dad helped me open it and we tried to dry it up. 
Later I was taking the trash outside and cut my thumb on a dirty can. I then allowed me a fucking cigarette (I don't usually smoke) and it was somehow fucked up and tasted the worst I've ever tasted. 
Now, writing this, I just realized I'm missing a work meeting - at least it's not from the same company. 
I'm accepting advice on how to deal with a wet keyboard, being stuck at home for months with your parents to whom you're the angriest, and how to choose better cigarettes. Also, how to explain to my coworkers that I missed the meeting bc I was writing a text for internet points.

TL;DR: I got angry with my mom and got distracted then spilled water on my computer during a class I was teaching. Then proceeded to keep ruining my day.",5,1,dogapuda

So my English teacher wanted to use webex for the online class and me being a dumbass muted the website even before entering so I can't hear anything. So I begin searching the web for an answer. When I found that muting the website means you are muting everyone, I almost wanted to leave yet here am I writing this post. So I unmute myself, so I can finally hear my teacher but I didn't realize my mic was on. I pretty sure the whole class hear me mumbling shit to myself but decide not to say anything. After like 5 minutes my teacher message me saying my mic was on and at that moment I realize I FUCK UP. I apologize to the teacher as i pretty I said something like this is stupid (to myself ofc) and quickly act like nothing happen by typing in the chat as the class had finished at that time.

I was already doing a lot better this semester, but since all of my classes have transitioned to online, I am back in the same predicament I was in last semester.

However, my grade has tanked and the day to withdraw has passed and I feel like I’m going to fail (They don’t release letter grades are until the end of the semester, so I have no idea how I’m doing). My college is allowing us to switch letter grades to a credit/no credit grading scale since the transition to online has been difficult to many students, so I could switch from a letter grade to a “no credit” grade to keep it from affecting my GPA.

5055,g5eyg3,2020-04-21 13:11:46,tifu,TIFU by trying to show up to my online class,"Background info, 17M, I'm currently taking an AP Chemistry class, and ever since quarantine started I've maintained a sleep schedule of 4-5 am to 2-3 pm.

  So I went online a few weeks ago and found out this is the only class I'm taking that regularly has online classes now that we're all quarantined.  I noticed that this class started at 8 or 9 am, which doesn't agree with my sleep schedule in the slightest.  You know who else doesn't agree with my sleep schedule?  My mom.

  Fast forward to Sunday the 19th, I hadn't even tried to show up to an online class, my sleep schedule is getting worse but hey I'm not complaining about that one tbh. I decide I'm going to stay up all night so I can attend a class in the morning.  I woke up at 3 in the afternoon, so I expected I should have just enough energy to make it through a class.

  I got on my PS4 to spend the late hours, as usual.  I played GTA with some friends from around 1:30 am until 7 am, when I decided to call it a night.  Left my games room and snuck upstairs to my bedroom without waking up my mom, sister, or dog.  I don't have to worry about waking up Dad because he had already left for work, and he can sleep through anything.

  I open up google classroom after waking up and eating breakfast, and see there was a class chat at 9 am.  Oh well, guess I'll try tomorrow!

  Did the same thing going into this morning but I never called it a night.  This is where the fuck-up begins.  It was around 8:05 am on Tuesday the 21st when my mom walks in on me raging at some asshole causing me grief in GTA.  My mom gets mad at me for staying up all night, and I explained to her that this is the only way I would be able to attend the online class.  At 8:15 am, I get the notification on google classroom that the meeting started. So I open the zoom app and copy/paste the link.  But it was shown to be an invalid link.

  And that's when I realized it was a google meet class, not a zoom class.

  So I go to the App Store to install google meet, and then I got the goddamned message on screen: this app requires IOS 11.0 or higher.

  I don't know what IOS my iPhone 5c is, but I know it's maxed out.  I gave up at this point and left to go to bed.  The door to my gaming room creaked louder than usual and my dog went batshit, probably waking up my sister in the process.  But my mom would not take no for an answer.  She wouldn't let me get some rest.  She made me go get our chrome book and join the meet, even though it's probably more than halfway over at this point.  I get the chrome book anyway and log in.  But of course there's another problem: my headphones are incompatible with it.  I really couldn't be assed anymore with this, so I give up.  My mom is grilling me about how I'm going to fail the course, but honestly I don't give a fuck anymore.  It's not a necessary course for me to even take, it's just a missed opportunity for a credit but I have plenty of opportunities and I still have another year before I graduate.  She's even talking about taking away the PS4 now.  **FUCK.  ME.**

• having time to make my own coffee(this may be normal for others but I procrastinate too much to implement this into my daily routine)
• Unlimited mental breaks while doing work
• I didn’t realize how enjoyable eating while learning could be
• The ability to replay my lectures, although in class I wouldn’t be as likely to miss what was said, there still would be times where I’d miss something and be too quiet of a person to try to get what was said

109,swr5ip,2022-02-20 03:03:02,tifu,TIFU by blurting out a swear word during one of my online classes.,"I have anger issues and I have been feeling on edge these past couple of weeks, because of burnout.

I prefer to be alone in a room when I'm conducting my online classes because I find it hard to focus when I'm hearing somebody else talking. We are currently on an online-only setup.

All of the other vacant rooms have been taken, we don't have our own separate rooms so we all conduct our online classes in the office.

I really don't do well with noise. It sometimes drives me to the point where I punch walls and recently I just wasn't able to control my anger well.

As you would expect from a group, they can be pretty noisy. It has always been the case though, every time someone is in an online class nobody just seems to mind that they are being loud and disruptive.

It's a Friday afternoon, everyone was just chatting away. I managed to complete an hour of my online class without losing control. It really drives me insane, when someone is being loud, especially when someone is making those incoherent noises. The building next to ours is also being demolished, so there's that. I have 30 mins to go, but then they started getting louder. My anger is at its peak when someone pushed off the table that I'm using because they are mopping the floor. It was only a slight push, I wouldn't have minded it but my frustrations have piled up and I lost control.

I muttered a profanity, the worst kind in my language, my students heard it, the other teacher heard it. It was a moment of instant regret for me. I just skipped the rest of the activities and ended the class. I apologized to the students later on and I've yet to apologize to my co-teacher who was only innocently mopping the floor.

It makes me feel terrible, I don't even know how to continue from here. I'm planning on just giving the kids the handouts and an online assessment for the following weeks.

It seems like I'm the only one who has an issue with the noise. I wish I hadn't reacted that way. There's no excuse for it no matter how loud they may have been.

I was planning on taking some mindfulness courses before. I guess I can't delay that any further.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**: I was meeting a class online and I lost it when the noise around me became too much for me to bear.  I wasn't able to control my anger and have muttered a swear word and the entire class heard it. The students said that they understand and that it's okay, but it still makes me feel terrible.",4,1,SkyCaptain_1
115,svc3p5,2022-02-18 07:32:13,college,Am I being unreasonable for being frustrated at having to participate in an online class 7 days per week?,"tl;dr: thought i had to login 5 days a week, actually has to be 7 days a week. i said whatever, since minimum for credit is 3 days a week as per professor and attendance/discussions are only 20% of my grade, i logged in and participated M-F (more than minimum). come back from my weekend off to a passive aggressive email from my prof about not logging in over the weekend. 



as per an announcement by one of my professors, she's requiring that we login and interact on discussion boards daily for full credit. 
as in 7 days a week. 

now, in her syllabus, it has the topics to be discussed each week. under discussion expectations, it says we have to interact daily in the course but 3 exchanges per week is adequate/minimal credit, answer discussion questions within 48 hours, we have to respond to every single time a student or instructor responds to our discussion post. i read this and (assume) she means daily (Mon-Fri). no problem, all my other courses require 2-3 minimum interactions within the week, but i shrugged it off and was fine with it. 

she usually opens discussions for the following week on sundays. (biomedical ethics class) 
so usually i will read the discussion questions on monday prior to reading the chapter(s) keeping them in mind as i read. answer questions tuesday (this can take up to 2-3 hours, as they are questions that usually require you to take a position, defend it, review a case study). on wednesday i will read some of my peers posts and respond to a couple, thursday i will respond to anyone who responded to me. friday closed up any interactions or make any final  remarks. 

well this past sunday, she posts an announcement to the class: ""housekeeping: you are expected to login DAILY."" blah blah blah some other stuff. i think about it and i think to myself..surely that doesn't mean 7 days a week? 

i shrug it off and say, fine, whatever, even if it is 7 days a week, i did more (5 days) than the minimum (3 days). it's annoying but discussions/participation are literally 20% of my final grade and i did more than the minimum. i'm confident that i am grasping the coursework that i will do well on the quizzes and exams. i typically don't login on weekends unless something is specifically due to be done at that time. 

the next day, (this monday) around 4-5pm, pull out my laptop, i login to check my school email prior to starting my school work, and the prof. has emailed me about an hour prior (3PM). 

subject was ""attendance.""
""____,
You have not logged into the course in the past 3 days.
Prof. ___.""

I'm assuming that she means Saturday, Sunday and what was now half of Monday. this also confirmed she means 7 days per week. and the email being at 3pm was also annoying cause i specifically choose online so that i can do schoolwork later in the day (i am much more productive in the evening, also able to focus more bc my bf is off work and can watch our 6 crazy ass huskies and i can focus.) 

it's like one thing to have this (what i think is oddly excessive ) requirement...it's another to personally email me confronting me about it? 

i ignored the message and went on to work on my discussion questions for the week, but it's lingering in the back of my head and making me insane. 

half of me wants to passive-aggressively respond and ask if i'm supposed to login on federal holidays, am i allowed sick days, what if i'm traveling and don't have access to a computer, do i need my mom to write a note for me? i mean wtf. 

is this normal? i thought the entire point of online classes was that it's good for those needing a flexible schedule. i get that, yes i could spend 10 mins on the weekend logging in, but once i login i am in the mindset of school/work and im the trade off was fine with me. there are also a few things we do regularly on the weekends (bf is very active in rugby so saturdays are usually slammed all day events, with occasional travel out of state for full weekend tournament matches that. and i help do first aid for the tournaments, etc). it's not something i want to worry about when i get home at midnight after being on my feet all day.  i was fine with deduction of a few points if it means i can have weekends to turn off and have time for ""me."" 

but now i'm personally getting a passive aggressive email about it taking weekend off when i exceeded the minimum? 

is this a thing? last time i was in college a few yrs ago i was full time in person so this is my first experience with online classes and all of my other classes have been great so far, except for this one. 

do i email back and tell her that i did the minimum and to expect me to take weekends off? do i just ignore it and any other potential future emails when i don't login on the weekend?

no clue as to how my attendance has impacted my grade thus far because she has yet to post any grades despite it being 4 discussions (weeks) into the semester.",4,1,xxrowanleigh

569,pq67sx,2021-09-17 18:50:22,college,I’m really struggling in my online class and I’m scared I’m going to fail.,"In my previous classes: Intro to Psychology, psychology human growth and development, Bio A&amp;P I, English 101, intro to Religion, and college algebra classes, I got all A+ in all and the class outline and format was mostly clear, interactive, easy to follow, and I had (for the most part) no problems succeeding because the instructors would help me if needed and I enjoyed the diversity of ways to learn in those classes (discussion posts, interactive websites, audio books, short sweet to the point lectures with resources, clear due dates and a pacing schedule, etc) I could see what I got wrong on assignments, quizzes, and tests so I could go revisit that question and topic and study for the final.
But now I’m taking Bio A&amp;P II online, and this class is so dreadfully terrible. The only content posted on the student portal for the class is a narrated 300-350 page slide per chapter, each chapters PowerPoint is posted on the Monday of the week and the quizzes are due fridays. it’s very redundant, boring, and repetitive and I am having the hardest time making it through these slides. I’m so behind and this is not like me. (I work full time weeks too) There is no discussion posts, no interactive websites, limited communication with the professor (one word or one sentence responses, if I ask multiple questions she answers one and done), due dates are all at the end of the class or spread out sporadically. The class consists of just super long PowerPoints and 2 quizzes weekly. The quizzes are pinpoint specific and something you have to go through 300 slides to find. There’s 3 unit tests and 1 final at the end, and the instructor told me she can not let students see what they got wrong on the weekly quizzes or unit tests. Why can’t I learn from my mistakes?
Also, the lab portion is seperate with a different instructor and the layout/communication between lecture/lab is ridiculous. Lab teaches anatomy and lecture teaches physiology, but the lab assignments/videos per topic are one week after the lecture ones (lecture covers it first then lab follows the following week) which means we visit the anatomy of the lecture chapter AFTER the physiology is introduced. How does that make sense?? It’s so hard to learn physiology without even knowing the basic anatomy? It makes sense to do anatomy first then talk about physiology when you know how to identify the organs and systems. Or is that just me?
Bio a&amp;p I was so much more tolerable and lab did anatomy the week before lecture covered the physiology. Anyway, does anyone have any tips for what I could do to make this better? I’ve already bought A&amp;P for dummies, it’s just so hard to progress knowing I missed stuff on the wuizzes and can’t revisit and I know I’m gonna not know it for the final or unit tests if I don’t now.

763,p1miti,2021-08-10 10:30:25,teenagers,Can my teacher be using a software to detect background activity in my device during online class?," 

Some context: My teachers are all lagging behind in school, and I have covered several chapters before them. I have long duration online classes and I don't want to spend hours going through the topics I have already covered. So during this time I either read articles online with the meeting running in background, or I scroll Reddit or I search up some NSFW stuff too. My meetings take place on MS Teams.

Our school has a website of its own with recorded lectures (just like Khan Academy) and when a student is using the website and attending the meetings at the same time, the teachers know.

They even showed us a chart with the names of students doing this. I guess they detect IP addresses to do this, but I'm not sure.

What my main concern is, can they be tracking what is going on in my screen at all times? I'll be totally fucked if they can.

1. Some details (might be useful, might be not, idk):
2. I use my own personal PC for my classes.
3. The school has provided each student with a personal Microsoft ID and they know the passwords.
4. My head teacher has MS Excel opened at all times. The site usage detecting chart was in Excel.
5. He also has a weird looking app with a scissor as the icon. I have no idea what that app's purpose is. I can share it's picture if anyone thinks this might be important.

So that was it, I will be very, very grateful if anyone could provide some insight into my concern.",4,1,reddittimepass2

It’s difficult asking for LOR’s from online profs, isn’t it? At least for me it is because we don’t get to really form any in person connection with them.

I got ghosted last semester by the two profs I asked for LOR’s from. Non-synchronous classes. I had finished with final grades of A’s. Did all homework, message posts, exams, quizzes. I had written emails on canvas, complementing their class and requesting an LOR. But they did not respond. 

This semester I have a prof that I had a zoom class with, and she seems like she liked me. I always had my camera on and I participated, ended the class with an A, did all assignments. Also another I had non-synchronous class i also got an A, and is a likely LOR candidate. 

(my chem 2 prof put out an announcement specifically requesting we do NOT ask him for LOR’s. Lol. Nice! )

Anyway so now I’m nervous.

1426,m3kjy3,2021-03-12 16:00:00,uAlberta,1 year of online classes... as told by a former homeschooler.,"It’s March 12th, 2020. The virus is spreading around the globe. I have heard of this “mysterious new virus” around New Years 2020, and considering it was from China, where 1 in 7 people of the entire world lives in, I knew it was only a matter of time before it came to Edmonton. When I first heard about this coronavirus, I first thought, “oh, so it’ll be like SARS back in 2003.” You know, that virus that disappeared after about 10 months. (Yes, it technically persisted on for another 11 months but shhh, optimism.)

My dad already told me to wear gloves and to not touch my face earlier in the day, and I managed to do all that. After classes, I hopped on the bus home with many other people crammed into a small space. Some coughed a bit, many without covering. I got home, did my homework, and had dinner. There, my dad told me that he doesn’t want me to go on campus for some time, and told me about the possibility of just staying home. My class the next day was at 10:00 AM, so I’ll have plenty of time to get ready.

The next day, I woke up at around 8:00. I checked my phone, and some emails mentioned that on-campus classes were canceled. A few emails further clarified that all classes are moving online for the rest of the semester.

Fine by me. I like sending assignments electronically anyway.

Some time passed by, and I realized the COVID graphs were not showing any signs of peaking, and just when you thought they stopped, here comes another wave. It’s later revealed that Spring/Summer courses are going to be online too, and that they’ll send a kit for one of my classes in ECE.

Two weeks into online classes, I started to notice something:

This is homeschooling all over again.

Not just the fact that I’m doing school at home, but also the self-pacing, sharing a house with 5 siblings, 3 of which are already homeschooling and 2 or 3 of whom are notoriously loud and annoying, and also the general feeling that there is no escape.

Some advice?

* If you live with family, for the love of Henry Marshall Tory, **TELL THEM WHEN AND HOW THEIR ACTIONS AFFECT YOUR STUDYING.** I had to put up with my youngest brother and his arguments for many months now, to the point where I was going to lose it. It got so bad that when the online school (the homeschooling I had was with a province-wide diploma-accredited online school) offered to waive the final exam requirements for my younger siblings, my mom took it just so she wouldn’t have to fight with my youngest brother.
* If you have the chance and need one, please, PLEASE, ***PLEASE*** get a therapist. Especially if you’re struggling and/or reaching a breaking point. It is very important to get the help that you need. https://www.ualberta.ca/current-students/counselling/index.html
* Have a mentality of being able to find information on your own. It’s more than just being able to look up the answer; it’s knowing the specific details of a question to see what is truly being asked and what the unknowns are.
* Make a schedule, please. And if you don’t, at least use the university schedule. If you’re not attending the synchronous lectures, at least work on assignments relevant to whatever course is happening during that time.
* If possible, get a drawing tablet or something to digitally handwrite notes onto a computer. I have a Wacom Intuos tablet that an uncle of mine gave as a present, and I’ve been using it a lot for writing assignments in OneNote.

There was also the fact that I chose 2020 to be the year where I’d “turn it around,” considering I never held a job and my volunteering sessions were few and far between. It was also a chance to make some money on a side gig that required me to access the campus. My, how that blew away.

There’s still a hope of doing Fall 2021 on campus, but unless Pfizer and Moderna make more vaccines, other producers of vaccines make them effectively and in large numbers, governments from all levels get their acts together, many more people start following the rules and actually use the proper measures, or some combination of all four, I won’t hold my breath.

Still, check for things that you can do at home. For example, I was able to take and pass a CSWA Associates exam, which is free through the university and would help me in the future as proof that I know how to use a CAD program. And I’m currently part of the ARVP club designing the website and doing some minor tasks. Check with your faculty and/or student associations if there are such resume-building activities that you can do.

We all know how difficult one year of online classes are, especially to those who haven’t had experience with it before. Even one of my professors had trouble with the Beartracks update! I hope the advice I give would help some people out there, and here’s to hoping Fall 2021 is in person once again!",4,1,SivleFred

“Whoever Receives This ticket will get a free trip to the potato chip factory. Turn it in at your local grocery store to get your free trip” So u/Zestyclose-Ad-9260 Turned in the ticket to the cashier and the cashier gave him another ticket which had the location where u/Zestyclose-Ad-9260 Needed to go.

A Kind Man Said “Woah You have the ticket here come in the bus” So u/Zestyclose-Ad-9260 Came into the bus and the bus finally arrived at the potato chip factory. u/Zestyclose-Ad-9260 Entered the Factory and the fresh smell of potato chips was blooming in the air but things went horribly wrong when A Worked accidentally electrocuted himself with one of the machines and the machine started to malfunction causing it to spill hot boiling oil everywhere. Luckily the oil didn’t hit u/Zestyclose-Ad-9260 But It Was Already A Bad Start. u/Zestyclose-Ad-9260 Went to the part of the factory where potatoes are being peeled but The Leaking oil ruined the potato peeler and it started throwing potato peels all over the place and a bunch of potato peels fell on u/Zestyclose-Ad-9260. Then due to more oil spilling all the machines in the factory started to malfunction.

1495,lx9lo7,2021-03-04 01:38:24,ADHD,I dropped college the first week because i couldn't cope with all-online classes and i feel ashamed and disgusted of myself.,"This week would've been the first of my undergrad. I was excited to finally start university. I didn't even make it past the first week without having a mental breakdown. It has been a week, and every day i'd sit through my first lectures feeling physically sick to my stomach because of the stress. My brain doesn't even register that i'm supposed to be attending a class online because there is no structure. I'm on Ritalin, but even meds can't stop my mental fatigue.

Even without ADHD, my workspace is an absolute nightmare. I have neighbours that are obnoxiously loud and scream for hours during the day. I can't concentrate at home. I'm depressed from the lack of social interaction. I went through a bad breakup a few months ago that caused me to lose a great chunk of my friend group. I just want to lie in bed and pretend i don't exist. 

I managed my way through most of high school with undiagnosed ADHD before dropping out in senior year to do a trade, but the world was different then. Even then, i was told endlessly by teachers that i was smart, but wasted potential. I see what they meant by that, now.

My father called me a lazy disappointment and that i should ""try harder"" It's hard to do that in a pandemic that makes everything even harder for people like me. All i want is to defer my degree to another year when maybe things go back to some semblance of normalcy. I know they probably won't, and that terrifies me. 

People also hype up University because of the social aspect. I can't even get that right now. Talking to people online isn't the same. I should just accept that i belong nowhere. I'll always be alone.",4,15,greenspacedorito

Minutes after the end of my last class, inutusan ako ng mom ko na pumuntang 7/11 para mag cash in sa gcash (may binibinili siya na kailangang bayaran)

FOUR TIMES. FOUR FUCKING TIMES AKONG PABALIK- BALIK DAHIL LAGING MALI IYONG NUMBER. Sobrang init nung oras na iyon. Nung panghuling beses pagkauwi ko, sabi sa akin, ""bakit kasi hindi mo rin chineck?"" 

Hindi ko na napigilan ang sarili ko at sumagot ako ng ""bakit ako? pagod na pagod na ako""

At ginawa na naman niya ang lagi niyang ginagawa, threatening to kill herself saying it was my fault. What happened hours ago was different and knowing my nature, I got scared. Nagdasal siya nang nagdasal na kunin na siya ni Lord ay at kasalanan ko raw iyon. Kani- kanina lang, nag- abot kaming gising sa baba kasi nag cr siya tapos uminom akong tubig. Sabi niya ""gising pa rin ako"" at nagdasal na naman na isinusuko na niya ang buhay niya.

Imagine what I am feeling right now. I won't be able to focus on my class because of that. How can a parent be that emotionally- manipulative to the extent of using God and threatening to kill herself saying it is my fault.

I am scared. I do not know what to do. I have been crying my eyes out for hours. She always do that. She always blame me for how her life turned out, saying it was my fault.

Took a quiz and got a good score, so far so good. then I chatted with my classmates and one of them asked what this Anime is in the video and I told them to look for it themselves and I knew. they didn't believe me and all I said was I was tired of them always asking me to find everything they want when I don't want to. eventually they asked to look for the girl who was in Attack On Titans that looked like Isabella from The Promised Neverland. I told them it was Tpn and they had the urge to say ""Paradise Neverland"". I explain about it and they wouldn't believe me. I told them ""mhmm yeah right okay"". and not even a minute later they said and I quote, ""Im scared for the next class because it's math and Math is hard"". I knew the basics of that lesson and THEN THEY START PRESSURING ME TO TEACH THEM. LIKE, HELLO?? YOU JUST MADE ME ANGRY JUST BY CONFUSING TWO VERYYY DIFFERENT TITLES AND NOW YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT?? anyways I tried to keep in my anger because I am not feeling good today. then I told them ""For God's sake, they are different."" and THEY STARTED TREATING ""GOD'S SAKE"" AS A CUSS WORD?? EXCUSE ME SIR BUT I'M PRETTY SURE YOU USED TO BULLY ME BECAUSE I'M AN ATHEIST??? HELL, THAT ONE TIME EVERYONE IN THE ENTIRE SCHOOL DURING RECESS OVERREACTED BECAUSE SOMETHING FELL AND I SAID ""Oh heck"", THEY EVEN DRAGGED MY MOTHER INTO THAT TIME??? the next call started and I ignored it because I didn't want to join a call with that person and then I vented my feelings out on the chat yourself thing except I accidentally sent it to the other school gc with him in it.

Now I can be a virtual class listening to the teacher while eating fist fulls of tostitos and no one can judge me for it. All I gotta due is keep my camera and mic off so I can basically do whatever I’d like during them tho I’d like to actually pay attention and pass so eating during class while just lying back on my bed is the best part of this.

My colleges policy requires professors respond in a maximum of 72 hours, but a month passes and nothing from them. There were even students emailing the whole class in hopes of getting help. The classes were stats and business communications. The stats class had lots of math involved and with no response from the professor, everyone struggled on the exams. The business commutations class software locked everyone out so no one did anything for a month and all got counted late. There were assignments that required the professor to look over them, but they never got graded. I  emailed the dean and they couldn’t even get a response.

Everyone excitedly replies,""YES!""

 So instead of being mature or holding myself accountable for my lack of work, I clicked the X on the top right of my screen.

Second, you need a groupchat with everyone of your classmates that you trust, I did this with about seventeen. You need a majority of them to not join the conference and just a few to stay in and report back. Probably the most important part is to make sure none of the people who are supposed to stay out, stay out. If they go in at all and the teacher notices, they have to stay or get back in there right away. For my teacher they made an assignment for the people who “couldn’t” get in and they were able to stay out. Others we trickled in randomly. Third you gotta delete that groupchat and delete all those messages.

We’re probably never gonna do this for at least a few months, but as long as no one is a rat you shouldn’t get caught. They can’t really blame you for bad internet so it works as the best thing to blame.",4,1,Dragonborn9898

Whenever I get the link to join it, I post it in my city's teen's discord server.

Everyday some guys come with different ID's and play some inappropriate songs or make fart or moaning sounds on the mic. Teacher kicks them everyday.

I did the same today but this time those guys went too far.

The teacher's wife called him for some reason and he went for a few minutes, leaving the class without any teacher.

One of the guys turned on the camera and started Masturbating!! I swear its true. I even have the screenshot of it.

When the teacher rejoined the class, he immediately kicked him out. He was too late coz the guy already nutted!!

And now the teacher is asking who spreads the link of the class.

2930,jk3m1p,2020-10-29 04:27:59,college,I accidentally slept during my online class,"I have an online class at 8am on Mondays and Wednesdays. This morning, like an idiot, I snoozed my alarm until 7.55. I basically pulled my laptop out, put it on my stomach, joined the zoom, and fell right back asleep. I woke up over 2 and a half hours later only to find that I'd been alone for more than an hour. 

I'm so embarrassed. My professor hasn't said anything but it's really obvious. We take a quiz every class to make sure we did the reading and I won't have submitted it despite appearing present. Also, I can only assume he tried to ask me if I was staying after for a reason.

Should I say something? Should I send an email? I've just been red in the face over this all day. 

This also... isn't the first time this has happened. The last time I was only alone for a couple minutes and never really fell asleep just stayed half asleep basically. I'm worried the prof is going to think less of me. Maybe he should. 

I don't even know why this is happening. I had plenty of sleep. I typically do. I've already gone to the doctor for the issue of sleeping 11+ hours a day. All my vitamin levels are good, I'm on antidepressants so I doubt it's related to my depression. I haven't done a sleep study but it's not covered by my insurance so I'd have to pay for it. I've started working out and hoping that'll help.

Something to know about me is I’m a fairly hairy person. You’d never know, since I shave quite often. I prefer to be hairless, so I shave my arms, legs, thighs, back, chest and stomach, face, and I sometimes pluck my toe hairs. 

Due to shaving all the time, I cut myself often and my ankles will tell you all you need to know. 

I showered, exfoliated, shaved, and was about to moisturize before I realized I was late to my zoom class. I leaned on my bed to click on the link to join (dont worry I had tape blocking the camera), and ran to smear myself in lotion like a greased pig.

Looked at my bedsheets and saw blood. I was confused and really upset, since my sheets are white, but I wasn’t on my period and I had looked all over my legs before even leaving the bathroom.

Turns out I had cut my elbow by shaving a bit too carelessly, it was my last limb and I had gotten lazy.

Now I have a blood stain on my white sheets, all because I just *had* to rush a shower.

3397,iwx3r2,2020-09-21 09:25:22,Professors,"I am fed up with taking notes for my online classes, so I and my friends have thought of solving this problem","Hey fellow Reddit users,

I am doing my research projects and all classes are online. Classes are happening on Zoom and it has become a pain to take the notes of the classes. It is very difficult to focus on the class and at the same time unproductive to take classroom notes.

Also, I am an engineer and I have hands-on experience in web development, so I thought of solving this problem. I spoke to some of my colleagues and my fellow professors and they all have the same problem. So we decided to work on this problem together.

So, now I along with my colleagues have started to work on a solution that we find can solve this problem.

**This is what we have made so far -**

1. An AI-Powered BOT that can join online classes on Zoom, Teams or Google Meet.
2. You can schedule your calendar so that the BOT can join the calls.
3. Record the entire call and give you the entire transcript of the class.
4. Summary, Highlights, Questions and Metrics (any numbers) that were discussed during the class.
5. Also, it can integrate with Slack classroom groups.
6. You can download the notes in Excel format or other formats as you want.

Some of my friends and other professors from my university are using the tool as Beta testers and I think it would be great if we get some more Beta users.

We think this can really help students and professors to get the classroom notes and also I can focus on the class rather than take notes.

You can see our website and also book a demo here - [www.rechord.ai/beta](https://www.rechord.ai/beta)

Currently, we are onboarding users with a private demo so that we can show you the tool and also onboard you during the demo.",4,1,dasatmadeep

I'm not risking going to the bars as one of the popular bars was already shut down for not following covid procedures, so my options for meeting new people are fairly limited. I'm here to post about what other people's opinions are on trying to make friends/ relationships with only online classes. 

Specifically, there's one really cute girl in one of my major related classes that's through zoom that I'd like to get to know more, and if it were in person everything would be much easier. We have the same major which is pretty small at my university, but this is our first class together. We're in a group chat so I have her number, but I'm just not sure if it'd be appropriate to just randomly reach out to her. Our professor makes the class fun and interactive, so our class of 10 is fairly close. I was thinking about texting her later on in the semester to get together and study. I feel like things would go well, but I wouldn't want to make the class awkward, especially since we do breakout groups.

I can't do it anymore, other students won't do it anymore.. so he continues to ask questions into this online void and no one has a reasonable response.

I got into a regular mess and then after dinner when I returned to my table ... it shocking stuck me that my class is near its end ... I immediately joined it and there was only the prof and TAs .. firstly I thought it's over now but when one TA asked me which breakout room(dedicated rooms inside a  zoom meeting) were you in... And I was like: ""a aa I was ... actually I couldn’t remember ... I forgot actually"" and that’s where I messed up .. prof than asked have you joined just now ... and I couldn’t refuse to him I said yes sir .. I forgot about the class ... again I am sorry sir.

He just said: no worries... it’s totally fine .. maybe we can share recorded video with you. (I got a mail just now.. sharing drive link)

And I regretfully thought about it .. that I messed up and figured out that I could just say the truth and I am not that guy who even try to hide anything from anyone ... I believe It would be better for me to just calm down for a sec before joining the class, saying to myself: mess happens .. don’t panic !!

And I hate discussion posts. They are annoying and the fact that I have reply to other people pisses me off. I'm taking a geometry 097 class and the teacher made us get a book for no goddam reason since all the homework/quizzes/tests are on webassign. Not to mention the fact she teaches through lecture videos that she didn't make. Yet we still have a mandatory zoom classes for questions.

Like everyone else, my college switched to online classes because of the pandemic last semester. I was taking 3 classes at the time, and I didn’t find it to be too hard to handle. Now I’m trying to sign up for classes but I am limited to online only classes right now because I live with immunocompromised family members. 

I’m wondering if the impromptu “online” classes that were previously our in-person classes that we all switched from the middle of the semester are basically the same as normal online classes? Or was that a watered down version of a typical online class due to the time constraints to come up with a quick solution to finish out the semester? I also took an online course in the summer but it was a relatively easy class anyways so I didn’t find it challenging at all. 

What I’m really debating is if I should sign up for the normal 12 credit hour amount schedule with online classes, or is that a completely different world than in-person classes? Thanks in advance!",4,1,thathappyhippie

4137,hsbsdn,2020-07-16 15:37:04,college,Some tips for online classes,"Having classes online sucks and it’s really hard for most people who are not used to them. Having had to finish most of last semester and my entire summer semester online, and with the online classes I took on high school, I developed a list of tips to help y’all get through this:

It can be really hard to focus during an online class. I have a tendency to pick up my phone cause no one will know I’m on it. However this is not good if you actually want to retain the information. I would suggest getting an app called [Flora ](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flora-focus-habit-tracker/id1225155794) or something like it. It stops you from leaving the app by timing how long you can stay on it and growing a virtual tree in the meantime.

A better way to keep focused for online classes is to take notes. Even if it’s not a class you would generally takes notes for, just do it. It can be messy and you only write down a few words here and there. But by even trying to take a short amount of notes you are actively listening for something to write down. 

If you do decide to take good notes, keep them organized and in order. Add in worksheets where they correspond to the notes as well. If you can keep them organized and in order, you’ll have a pretty good study guide for the end of the year to use. 

Have a reliable study area. It can be a desk that’s decorated to your taste, it can be your bed with a lap table in front of you, or it can be the grass outside. Just have a space you can go to where you can be comfortable, have a quiet space, and good WiFi connection. Also make sure to have your charger for whatever device you are using to join class through, it helps Incase it drains the battery. 

Set time aside outside of class for studying as well. And since you don’t have to leave the building after a class, your study time can start right when a class ends. I, like many of you probably, also have to go to work to pay rent and run errands. Make sure you have time set aside for that as well. 

As far as time management goes I’ve developed a system that works really well for me. Using a format like [this ](https://daydesigner.com/collections/printable-library/products/how-to-design-your-week) (which you can download for free from that website) I usually use it to plan my week. I color code with blocks for each of my classes, study time, work hours (including travel), errands and other things I have planned/have to do. I even put time aside time on there to do chores or have meals. It’s a great way to visualize each day by the hour and plan to effectively use your time wisely. 

Typing notes is not as good as writing them. That’s a fact. However if you do end up typing them, just try to read them as often as possible. Print them if you can as well. But if you can’t, you can still annotate them either way. Annotation is a good way to summarize your notes even better and review them in your head. 

Whether your typing or handwriting notes, teaching is the best way to learn. Now you don’t actually have to go find people to sit down and listen to you gobble about the subject. But you can just sit down and pretend your teaching someone. Use the notes to try and teach it out loud, do the practice problems and show the visuals. By doing this you’ll be able to point out the exact areas you are not able to explain and/or understand. 

Do all the extra work. Go online to [khan academy ](https://www.khanacademy.org) and review your subjects there, go to YouTube for explanations, read the textbook etc. By doing all of this your creating a backup for yourself to have for pop up quizzes and future need for understanding in order to move on to other chapters, and extra strength of knowledge for midterms and finals. 

Study effectively. Use flash cards for vocabulary, notable words, subjects or equations , which can be applied to almost every class. You can create virtual flashcards you don’t have to keep organized online at sites like [quizlet ](https://quizlet.com/features/flashcards). Re read your notes and re-do old worksheets. 

Besides that I would try to attend as many office hours are you can, trust me they can be your savior. 

Don’t give up as well. Online classes are gonna be really hard for those of you who are not used to them and completely despise them for ruining  the semester. But keep social distancing, wear a mask and maybe by spring or summer we can all return to our campuses. 

Ps- because classes are online, at least in the US you can take classes at ANY community. So if a class you need is full at your college, look for it at another community college and see if the units are transferable. 

Good luck everyone!! Stay safe, study hard, and make this year yours!",4,1,FirstForBurgers

There are a lot of considerations to make. For example, the accessibility of students in the lower social class. Not everyone can afford good internet for online classes and even gadgets alone for some. In the other hand, there can also be a consideration for those who can go with online classes. It's in good heart that we aim for this \#NoStudentLeftBehind thing. But what about those who are capable of advancing to the next level? The argument is *hindi naman nila kasalanan na may mga students that will be left behind*. I believe that neither side is wrong and both of them actually makes sense. These are only two factors to consider, there are still arguments about how classes can't be held online because it degrades the quality of learning compared to face to face classes and so on.

The workload, shitty Pearson exercises, textbooks, exams and assignments are exactly the same and many times, during team work, you can work with people from either type.

One of my profs opted to record class sessions and post them instead of doing live sessions. Ok, cool. That is totally a valid option.

I should have known this from the start, but I didn't piece it together: my prof can see if I have watched a session, when I watched a session, and how much of the session I watched.

As I'm sure most of you can relate, doing school at home is tremendously difficult--distractions everywhere, nonexistent motivation, the whole nine yards.

Like a fool, I put off watching ALL of these session until the last minute: when I have my big essay for the second half of the term due (due Thursday night, I writing this Wednesday evening).

I love and respect this prof so much. I have taken multiple classes from him and know him well. The fact that he can see my failure to ""attend"" class is horribly embarrassing. I feel awful imagining his thoughts of my procrastination. I couldn't help it. I had absolutely no motivation to watch the classes. I just couldn't get myself to do it. 

I feel awful. I feel like I let a friend down. It was all my fault, but at the same time it feels like it was out of my control. I don't know what to think. End rant.







TL;DR: I put off watching recorded class sessions to the last minute not realizing the prof can see when I viewed the classes. I'm terribly embarrassed and feel awful.",4,2,ChancellorWolf

We told her about that but she again yelled at us that we all are talking that is why her voice was cracking . She said that she will take the class afterwards as we don't have anything to do.

After that we found the problem and fixed it, I got my homework and everything was ok. However today, we didn't originally have a class , and I had waken up early to see if they had sent us a link , but they didn't . And so I waited and waited and messaged my friend about it but he was asleep I guess. 
 So it's 9:46 and the class starts at 10. At this point I go like fuck it and I lay down to sleep, because I have a full schedule today , and I resort to thinking that it was just a mistake . 
And then I wake up at 11:00 and I get messages from my friend from 9:56 telling me that the class is going to start. Now I am sitting here thinking about how much I have fucked up. It was extremely important that I attended it because the last time they were looking for my account. What excuse do I have.
Anyway I know no one will actually care to read this but it is the only way for me to get it out. I don't feel like telling it to anyone else because I feel like a big dumbass and I have no excuse. I am also going to get roasted for this so.... I should probably tell them that I had some problem with the WiFi and couldn't open anything.

5385,fvrhlb,2020-04-06 03:39:31,rutgers,online classes are tough,"okay so the main question that i need to know is this: ""Will professors tell you how you're doing in a class if you ask them, even if they don't post grades on sakai?""

now here's the context:

I don't know what is happening to me but ever since online classes started happening, for my spanish (advanced grammar and comp) class, I have been missing a shit shit SHIT ton of the homework, and it's 20% of our grades.

I'm so scared that I'm in danger of failing the class, and I want to withdraw, I think I have until the 10th to do it. 

I'm just really mad at myself because like, yeah the professor sucks but like this problem I've been having is 100% on me like there's no excuse for this shit. And like yeah it's good that I'm realizing that and know how to change and focus more and everything but like, I feel like I'm in too deep now. 

I feel like a fucking failure.

Like, I came in freshman year wanting to minor in spanish really excited that u know I could have harder classes and everything but this class has just torn all of my motivation out of me to the point where i wanna drop the minor entirely (I'm studying japanese and I love that language soooooo much more).

But part of me doesn't want to withdraw just in case I could be doing okay so that's why I posted this. I don't know what to do anymore. Everything sucks right now if you guys have any advice it would be much appreciated okay love you guys byeeee.",4,1,Mynameisbrk

I put on my clothes, I got my items ready, but for some reason, my girlfriend wanted to come with me. Remember that at this point my college had online classes at this time so I thought I could drive and listen to the online class simultaneously

My girlfriend and I  got into the car and I turned on my computer and joined the class. I placed the computer on the seat opposite to the driver's seat and faced it towards me.

 As I started driving my hot girlfriend took off my pants and started to sucking my huge penis. The online class started and my webcam was on. The entire class was watching my huge penis be sucked live!! I didn't even notice because it felt so good. I started to moan loudly. 

I rolled down one of my windows and stuck my head out and moaned out the window. Suddenly I grabbed my computer and threw my online class out the window. I was on the highway when I touched my girlfriend's big boob. I orgasmed and all the sperm came out of my huge dick. It felt really good so I closed my eyes and took my hands off the steering wheel.

My car hit a van with a family of 2 kids. Luckily no one was injured but I really fucked it up this time lads.

If you’re wondering how to stay motivated, social, or how it tends to work, I’d be happy to answer questions based on my experience. 

I’m not claiming to be an expert on online college education or how UMD will run things, but if you‘re confused, curious, or anxious about the switch than I’d be happy to discuss anything. 

Some tips to start:
1. Since you’ll probably have a lot more flexibility in your classes (particularly for technical classes which seem to be using prerecorded lecture videos) try to figure out when you tend to have the most mental energy during the day and do your most important/difficult work then. 
2. For any class that you have to write for, use Google docs and then invite a friend or classmate to review your work, using the comments feature. You can go back and forth on suggested changes, or have a video call to hash them out. 
3. Make sure to stay somewhat active, even if it’s just a walk around the block twice a day. Staying stationary in your house all day is not great for mental health.",4,1,lamar_in_shades

  Last month I went to a psychology appointment for anxiety and ended up talking about my trouble to focus and he said that I had adhd and gave me ritalin.

  I havent been using it for that much time but my grades have became better and my teachers dont complain about me not paying attention so often. I finally felt like my brain wasnt useless and that I had some control over it.

  And then corona happened....

  I've been listen to the online class for the past 30 minutes and it just feels like white noise and static, even with ritalin, I keep earing words that I recongnize but its like they don't any meaning and I keep getting lost with everything.

  I finally felt some improvement and now its gone and Im afraid that my grades will sufer when they were finally getting better.

I made the mistake of letting a student who made a personal request add the class before I checked the waitlist (I've always taught in person before, and this stuff is handled sort of automatically by classroom capacity). The waitlist is long, and I will likely get more personal requests than my TA and I can handle, grading-wise.

407,qje9vr,2021-10-31 00:31:38,CollegeRant,"Tired of online classes with in-person midterms and final exams, but I have no other option."," Sorry for the long rant, I'm just slowly getting more and more fed up with online classes due to the pandemic.

All the other colleges around me are back to face-to-face learning again except the one I enrolled in. Not only that, all other majors in *this* college are doing face-to-face learning, except computer science because apparently there are too many students for it to be feasible with Covid. When I was applying, I talked face to face to an administrator, who assured me that classes would **not** be online this year. Guess what, they changed their minds, despite the pandemic situation being *better* than it was (in my country at least) when I heard those words.

The very first lecture I attended had connectivity issues, since then \~half of them have had issues. This Wednesday the professor didn't even start the lecture, and only let us know on Friday that we'd be having a lecture on Saturday to make up for it. I wake up early and join the class only to see the professor can't get his mic to work, so he doesn't hold the lecture. I think whatever, I'll just join group 2 an hour later and view *their* lecture since nobody will care or notice me, but the professor says he won't be holding the lecture for any of the groups today due to the technical problem, so I went back to sleep. Of course when I woke up, I found out the other groups did hold the lecture after all and I missed it.

Of course, all exams will be held physically, so can't wait for that. No one will care that a lot of the lectures were not held at all, or that the professor had to teach the 1.5 hour lecture in 40 minutes because the online classes system was down for the first half of the lecture.

Also, this is my freshman year so I haven't been able to socialize at all, I have no idea who anyone in my 180 student class is, just random names and default profile pictures.",3,1,_negativeonetwelfth

I'm in grad school for a health care profession. My professor asked if schooling for our degree/program was free, would more people join the profession. I waited a bit, as I realize I have many unpopular opinions. I then posed a question to the group: If programs were free, would people join for the wrong reason? I did not state my opinion. Immediately, seven classmates retorted that they believed I was incorrect and that they were in this program for the money.

I feel really weird. I texted a few classmates, even one that disagreed with me. I said I was trying to elicit responses by my question and the responses from texting my peers were good or fine. I emailed my professor about my intention behind the question being curiosity. She responded that I did nothing wrong and that tensions were high.

I am questioning if this belongs in r/AITA. It was really odd to me. It is unfortunate to me that many of my classmates are going into this field because of money, while I thought most were going into it to help other people

523,pvldm4,2021-09-26 02:55:04,college,I think my professor has gone MIA in online class and I need advice on what to do,"I go to this one college who is known in my area for offering pretty good online classes. I decided to do them this semester (my first one). The other classes have been good but I'm having issues with my English class/professor. Started out fine. Teacher took a day or two to respond but that is normal. However, things took a bit of a turn recently. Last week she didn't post something we needed for an assignment. It seems like an email I sent her prompted her to send it out. We were also supposed to use our digital textbook for that assignment. It wasn't available/unlocked then but is now. 

This Tuesday she didn't respond to an email I had about some upcoming assignments. That I can kinda understand it comes with the territory. Except she didn't even post an entire assignment. It just isn't there.

She was supposed to post questions that we would respond to. That due date came and went and it wasn't there. It was Wednesday so you would think she should have noticed by now. I asked other students and it isn't a me problem. It seems like none of us could do it. I have another assignment due tomorrow and one of the things I am supposed to analyses isn't there. Sadly what she wrote about it is too vague to find anything. I tried looking and I was left with a lot of options. So if she doesn't suddenly respond I'll have to submit it without that part.

I ranted to my mother about this entire situation and she thinks she might have been fired. I think and I hope we would have been notified if that was the case. The best guess I have is from her last email. She said she was probably going to be grading our papers until today (Saturday). But I don't think (and I again hope) that it wouldn't cause her to not post an assignment. 

I need advice on what to do. This is my first semester so this could be normal at least for online classes. Should I just continue waiting? I can understand teachers not responding. But she didn't post an entire assignment. That is what is concerning me the most. I'll also have to submit something that isn't done. Should I get in contact with someone Monday? If so, what should I even say? I don't want to get on any faculty member's bad side. But at the same time I'm paying for this.",3,1,RotomeB
562,proufw,2021-09-20 06:04:13,ADHD,Just missed the deadline for another week's worth of assignments for online class. I'm fed up with myself.,"College has been a long and extremely difficult journey in many ways with my ADHD and anxiety. After multiple semesters of failing or withdrawing from all subjects, I slowly and painstakingly developed good habits and managed my symptoms a lot better in the past year or two. Yet, it seems like I just have a cycles or periods of health and wellness that burn out and I fall back into bad habits, and end up facing the same consequences - missing work, my health suffering, and the guilt and negative feelings associated with not meeting my goals or working toward them. I'm currently in an extra semester of college (I'm an extended senior, was supposed to graduate last semester). I watched all my peers graduate and go onto the next chapter of their lives - and of course I know I shouldn't compare, everyone has their problems, everyone's figuring out themselves, etc. but it's so hard not to at least feel like I'm constantly falling behind despite knowing my potential and that I am good enough to succeed in what I want out of life. 

But here I am, with only two courses currently, and a very modest amount of work (it would have taken me maybe an hour to complete the assignments I needed to do) and I just procrastinate and then miss the weekly deadlines for one of these courses. This is the third time. There are 6 weeks of assignments, and I've missed three of them. I've basically missed out on most of the points for the course, and even with drops worked in, I'm suffering another poor grade out of lack of discipline. No exceptions and no late grades. I can't drop the course because it's what I need to graduate. So I just have to stick with the bad letter grade, and I really needed the A. If I did this week of courses, I would have had a chance at an A with extra credit factored in. Now, it will be at most a B and although that doesn't sound bad - my GPA is below 3.00 (around 2.8-2.9) and would have needed the A. Also the fact that it looks so bad to not do well in these easy courses especially being a 5th year senior basically.

I don't know where to go from here. I have high aspirations for grad school/med school at some point but I just don't believe in myself anymore because I feel like what's the point if I can't even do basic stuff like not procrastinate easy assignments then miss the deadlines, multiple times. I'm medicated, and have been for years so that wouldn't be a solution. I've been to therapy but it only helps so much, although I need to schedule another appointment soon. I exercise daily, do my best to eat healthy, and have been cutting off using any substances. All of these things those have been failing lately though - I have been losing my motivation to work out, I eat like shit again, and I've relapsed on nicotine (quitting again tonight), have been smoking mj regularly (quitting that too), and have been falling back into bad habits like laying around in bed or picking my skin. I'm at a point where I feel like I'm just gonna keep doing things to self-sabotage my success or even if I am doing well in life, everything will fall apart eventually.

I used to be a star student and although life has never been perfect, at one point years ago I felt fulfilled and like I was in somewhat control of where I'm headed in life. But that's all I can hold onto now, is memories to reminisce from high school. My biggest accomplishment thus far still is a 35 on my ACT. I always remind myself of it to remind myself I can achieve great things in academia/building a career. But it feels like now I'm just a failure.

I want to do better.",3,1,HonorEtVeritas

How do I make a structure for the online classes when I have possible ADHD?,"I know I have quite a few features of ADHD: executive dysfunction, scrolling paralysis, procrastination, constant distraction even with my own thoughts, insomnia, disorganization, etc. Problem is it is EXTREMELY stupid hard to get a diagnosis as an adult female because it presents a lot different in women. Therefore, we're often not believed when we suggest it. That's why I can't really ask my uni for assistance in trying to work with a partially online semester. I'm also barely getting to meet a psych who even does assessments for ADHD in late September. I think I need to also mention I'm gonna be taking on two part-time student jobs. I want to try making some kind of structured learning method for those two online classes. Since they're asynchronous I really don't know how I would create time and methods to focus on each class.

824,opqgpm,2021-07-23 00:08:15,college,Taking an online class and haven’t learned anything.,"So I’m taking this online physics class and I got 100% on the exam today but it’s only bc all the answers were on quizlet. I don’t even think the professor cares bc the original professor is vacationing somewhere in Latin America, so they gave us some replacement guy and used old lectures and old tests. One student who was actually trying in the class perfectly stated that this class is literally impossible to do (I’m guessing he’s not searching up answers) and quite literally it is if you’re not using google. 

This is a weed out class in person and online there’s 40 questions of hw a week, 10 lectures a week (old recycled ones), and an hour exam, and the professor isn’t familiar with the material. It’s like they’re just knowingly like well we’re doing our job while knowing that everybody is going to cheat but it’s so hard that you have to.

Comparing this to a different class where the professor made his tests from scratch, he gave very helpful practice problems and the lectures were helpful, and so i actually studied and learned things. 

And I’m just afraid if this is going to bite me in the ass later bc the same thing happened for physics 1 and this is my second year of physics and I am not learning shit, but hopefully my GPA goes up.",3,1,LUVFIVE

I was having my online English class and like everyone I was wearing by shirt and shorts with my video turned on. Now the problem starts with me not paying attention in the class and rather reading other stuff on my PC. But due to how I positioned by laptop in front of my keyboard, to use the keyboard on the PC I had to tilt the laptop screen down, in hindsight I thought it would just show the touchpad on the video for a few seconds but boy, oh, boy was I wrong. :)

After I do that my friend texts me saying what the fuck I was doing and apparently my crotch and my beautiful blue colored shorts were visible for at least 5 seconds to everyone who unfortunately had me on their zoom grid. And now I have to end my life as I can show my face to no one at this point. The only lucky part is the teacher did not see, so, I think I can hold off on the dying part but still can't believe I showed my crotch.  


TL;DR I was not paying attention in class and I got karma by having my crotch on several other students' screens while trying to reach for my PC's keyboard behind my laptop",3,1,Zendovo

I answered my question wrong in front of the whole class and it was so embarrassing. 

I do have earphones that are 80% soundproof, meaning I still hear faint screaming. 

My grandparents doesn’t bother taking care of them and my parents are both working. I’ve asked my mom to child care centers but that’s useless for now because my country’s in lockdown.

So I was getting my daily dose of boredom in my social studies class when all of a sudden a bright idea came out of nowhere and slapped me in the face. And it was to plug my discord tag. So I pulled up discord, clicked on my tag to copy it, and then pasted it and sent it without checking. The only problem here though was that the message I sent was not my discord tag(which I could've sworn should've copied because it literally said ""Copied!""), but a roast I was reading from the internet. And that roast just so happened to be *""My dick is so big, that it can go from A to Z!"" ""Look at your keyboard""*. After realizing what I just did, I bolted from the meeting. Now my friends are laughing at my easily avoidable mistake if my dumbass had just checked before sending. As of right now, whenever somebody brings it up, I feel the utmost embarrassment, all because I felt like plugging my Discord tag, and Discord decided to glitch out on me.

TL;DR: I felt the need to plug my Discord tag and sent something non-school-friendly instead.",3,1,T4CT1CAL5NIP3R99

Half a dozen classmates texted me to tell me to sit down or cover up but he didn’t say anything. I’m hoping he didn’t see because he has 20 students but only 16 are shown at most on his screen.

So what does it mean to raid online classes , 

Random people'll join your class and makes weird and funny noises and stuffs? , umm yeah 

Now online classes are held in various platforms like Google Meet , MS Teams , Zoom etc

But to raid classes is not as easy you think it is, Many schools and colleges have their own custom domains , so, only accepted individuals can only join the meetings , which makes the stuff really hard. and you'll have to compromise one of your friend's account and do it . which you probably won't.

Advanced raiding includes , setting up HQ proxies or vps's to join from , if it is google meet , then verified google accounts, if you need anonymity , then you'll need to setup tor in all of your proxies. and set up a control panel to control those bots , which makes the stuff really hard. 

So here are some git repos , to do a simple raid , you'll just join many times in a single meet , you could do this from a cloud , so you do not  need to worry abt ram and stuffs. here :-

Well today, I found out that teachers could just MOVE the exam dates from their original exam dates on a class outline, which I went through the trouble of writing down top to bottom cuz i didn't have a printer. Missed a final exam that cost 40% of my grade for one class and missed an assignment that cost 20% for another.

Now it's totally my fault for not signing in to watch recordings of people talk about powerpoints, I can admit that, but holy crap maybe I should've just skipped school and saved up some money instead of taking up a loan to end up learning from Khan academy and Youtube.

Either way I'll be spending an extra year to finish two courses just because I didn't turn on my computer to look at something I really didn't think was important. Kinda sick of seeing the line ""I know these are troubling/difficult/strange times..."" blah blah mainly because it doesn't change the fact that in order to learn anything from my courses I have to look for it anywhere BUT where I'm supposed to be.

Really hoping all this blows over and we can return to not having to line up for grocery stores, travelling, hooking up and going to classrooms.

I was devastated. I was frantically apologising and I put my head on the table and cried.

I think I know why it happened. I had my cursor over the unmute button. I had it there because the teacher was asking questions and I was ready to unmute and answer if she asked me a question.

I’m 27f attending college online due to the pandemic. I’m at my best friend’s/fwb house cuddling bare naked and I’m in the lobby of the classroom on zoom before class starts. All of a sudden he starts to thrust into me and I suddenly find myself on top of him. While I’m on top, I notice that the lobby then changes to the classroom meeting and my camera turns on showing everyone my bare upper half. I ducked down and turned off the camera as fast as I could all the while feeling really embarrassed that I revealed myself. I told my fwb that the mood died and my class has started. He agreed and I put my clothes on and said “I’m not going camera for a while after that.” It was really bad that my face turned so red it felt hot to touch. I not even sure if I can show my on camera again after that. I know this may haunt me somewhere down the road. My friend was the lucky one to not be on camera by how it was angled. A huge part me wants to hide from the world for a while. 

TL;DR: I am now going to be more cautious of myself with how I’m dressed and my surroundings with my online classes. I feel like I’m the only one that when through this and feeling a bit humiliating knowing the fact my professor and classmates saw me with nothing on. I’m typing this post right now while being that same class.

2690,jxddms,2020-11-19 23:00:14,college,"Don’t want to do online classes again, but also want to graduate on time. Should I take a gap semester? What is the best option?","I need students’ opinions on what I should do next semester because parents, advisors, and college administrators just don’t understand the struggle of a college student navigating this pandemic.

I’m in my junior year, and I’m just so disenchanted, unmotivated, and depressed with college now thanks to Zoom University. I transferred to my current university in 2019 after a sad and unproductive year at my old one, but because of corona I only got a semester and a half of the true “college experience.” It is very important to me to be with friends, be involved in student organizations, make connections with my professors, and find opportunities. But since everything’s been online since March and will be again this Spring, I can’t do that as easily if at all, and what I can do is certainly not worth the price I’m paying for it (makes me think college is lowkey a scam...but here I am anyway oop). I was planning on studying abroad last summer or this spring in countries that handled COVID really well and were allowing foreigners in so I could avoid doing online classes again, but both programs were canceled by my university. Hooray for public health, not hooray for me :c f corona amirite?

Now, I have roughly 3 semesters worth of classes needed to graduate, so I could just do this shit again, but I really don’t want to take online classes next semester because it’s harming my mental health, it’s a waste of money since I’m not getting the benefits of being on campus, and I can’t learn effectively. So here are my other options:

1. Take a gap semester (and get a job or internship, or maybe travel if vaccines are distributed and it’s safer) and graduate a semester later than I planned. Maybe study abroad my final semester when all my friends have already graduated so I don’t miss out on seeing them for yet another year (Downside is that if I study abroad, my degree won’t be conferred for half a year, so I’d be “graduated” but with no degree for a while. Not so great for job prospects. If I don’t study abroad, I‘ll be kinda lonely on campus)

2. Take a gap semester, 4 summer classes, and load up on credits for my last 2 semesters so I can graduate on time. Maybe do a post-grad abroad program like Fullbright

3. Take 2 online classes this spring and 2 in the summer (leaving time for internships or jobs), and a regular course load next fall and spring (Downside is that underloading during a semester or doing summer classes cost way more than regular load during a semester, because they charge per credit rather than standard tuition for 12+ credits)

4. Hope that corona gets better and summer 2021 study abroad will be open. The program I’m looking at would give me 8 credits, so I can get away with taking only 1 class in the spring or summer and a regular course load next fall and spring.

I know this is complicated and y’all probably don’t care but it was worth a shot asking🤷🏻‍♀️

P.S. I would really likebto study abroad at some point and/or graduate with the rest of my class, which is why these options aren’t just super obvious or easy to me. Yes I’m picky, but when you’re paying so much for something you kinda want to get what you pay for :/",3,1,rosetintedmuse

2809,jsv8xn,2020-11-12 14:12:15,tifu,TIFU when I accidentally said something in my online classes instead of our Discord voicechat,"So this actually happened a month ago. 

(ik fuck ups in online classes are quite common but I wanted to post mine anyway)

We had an online class on Zoom discussing about a research. We were then grouped into 11 groups to discuss our answers and was then sent into our own breakout rooms. At that time, I was also voice chatting with my friends (who were also my classmates) on Discord since we get bored easily when listening and one our friends who was on another group needed my help.

So my situation was that I was speaking both to my group on our Zoom and into our Discord (no I didn't mute my mic because I was lazy lmao).

Shortly after, the breakout rooms were ended and we were sent back into the main Zoom meeting. The teacher told us that we can now mute our mics again because she's going to discuss something short first and told us that she will dismiss us after. Now here is where I fucked up. I didn't mute my mic on Google Meet yet because I forgot and got distracted on Discord at that time when she said that, when I said to my friends ""Finally we're done. I'm fucking tired of this.""

Suddenly, my teacher and the entire class got silent and I wondered why. I checked back on Zoom to see that my mic wasn't muted. Instantly, my heart pounded out of my damn chest.

Now usually, I'm seen as a ""good guy"" in our class. I do pretty well academically and I'm actually a very silent guy when you meet me in real life, so they never expected to hear me say that.

My teacher then reprimanded me and told me that she doesn't want to hear that again in the class. Obviously, I got embarrassed and apologized after the online class by sending her a private message in her Facebook.

tl;dr: accidentally told my teacher ""I'm fucking tired of this."" while in an online class.",3,1,SgtRohn

I fucking hate how our Department Of Education (DepEd) decided to resume classes. They literally resumed classes just for money. I hope the COVID19 Vaccine will be available soon so I won’t have to deal with this *STUPID* online classes anymore and resume to normal classes where I can know what are the Assignments, Projects, and Tests and where there isn’t any random bullshit at my home to distract me from not listening.

We were suppose to meet back up at half past and I logged out because I misheard him and thought we were allowed to do that. Not to mention I was only really listening to the lesson through my Bluetooth earphones while doing other stuff in the first place.

Well long story short instead of doing the set exercises I instead overhauled my entire wardrobe and picked out all of the old clothes I wanted to get rid of, and re-organised the ones I wanted to keep.

I came back into class late and the teacher asked me why I didn't answer when he checked in half way through us doing the exercises, and I had to bullsh*t my way out of getting in trouble.

Anyways, title says it all. I kind of have the type of social anxiety when I’ll basically have a panic attack, leave the call, and basically just have a 30 minute session of crying if I just hear the words, ‘everyone’s going to be doing an introduction, so we all get to know each other.’ 

I genuinely hate myself because of this, and it gets to the point where I wanna just kill myself, or at least run away just to avoid this. I’d also like to point out, I genuinely like life, and I’d never wanna kill myself, but my social anxiety’s too much for me too handle.

I’ve tried therapy and it works until it hits the part where my therapist starts telling me my next goal is something big like attempting to make a friend, presenting in front of the class, etc. and then everything I’ve been doing in therapy just leaves and I become the super shy crybaby, again.

My parents are also very aware of this, but they both don’t really believe in mental illness and so they usually tell me that one day it’s gonna just go away, or that I need to get over myself. 

 Should I just try to man up and face the world? Or should I try therapy again? Or just ask the teachers about it? I genuinely don’t know, and possibly just killing myself to end it all and avoid the anxiety sounds like the easiest option, so does running away, but I still have so much I want to do in life, and I don’t wanna end it or ruin it just because of my social anxiety.",3,1,FeelingShape9

Like a lot of others, almost all of my classes are online this semester. Some are asynchronous, but some have ""face-to-face"" class time through Zoom for our usual class times. It's all really messy and kind of inconsistent.

I have severe ADHD among other things (I'm medicated), and managed well during normal semesters because of the setting of actually being *at* college a lot of the time. However, now that I'm mostly going to be at home, I'm really freaked out at the idea of getting into/staying in ""school brain"", properly absorbing info, staying motivated for school work, etc.

Well my family switched insurance, and long story short I was not able to access medications for my Vyvanse or my Setraline depression meds, and I went on a complete downward spiral. I missed a deadline, to dunk it stuff  then another, and have felt like such complete shit mentally. I’m back on my meds but I still am basically just paralyzed in fear. For some reason whenever I go to do schoolwork I freeze up in crippling anxiety as a result of the rut I got myself in. I’m two scared to even check my email. I’ve been living in this fear and let it consume me so much I’ve ghosted  friends who wanna hang out with me and just sat on my couch trembling about what to even say to my professor. Classes are ending soon and I really wanna get any points I can from stuff I missed but I don’t even know where  to start or what to say. Fuck. I’m worried I’m going to be judged, viewed as a lazy student, not be taken seriously. I don’t know what to do guys. I’ve been letting this build up for no reason.",3,1,ireallylike808s

With that, we’ll have online classes and i’m not excited about those at all.  I had changed my sleep schedule to sleeping at 1-2 am and waking up at 10 or 11, now i’ll have to wake up at 7, get ready, and start working at 8:30.

To add up, i’ve grown to dislike some of my classmate, especially for their attitudes in class (always talking, it derange me since I’m easily distracted by noise, also, autism). So i’m not excited to see them.

There is also the fact that since our school was laid back and giving us less work, we’ll have more to do for sure and in a months and some days (school ends the 19th of June for me).",3,1,God-Emperor-of-Emoji

The classes I’m taking are preparing me for the internship I have this summer and knowing me, I’d procrastinate until then if they cancel classes. The grades are incentives for me to keep studying.

 Basically,  if we don't have great internet, we won't be able to keep up with others in our class. I live in a rural area, and since everyone came back home in my street, the wifi is incredibly slow. My sister is back as well and she's always using the internet to watch stupid and useless shit, so it's clear that I just can't do online classes. In order to be accepted in my university program, I need a high GPA. Since the beginning of the semester, I've been working really hard to get a good one, and my grades were finally great !! But I know for sure that once classes are online, my internet will keep me from learning. I did an online class in high school, and I just couldn't do it because I need a teacher to answer my questions and explain the same thing many times, and it just won't happen if I have to ask via messages. Heck, even calling teachers couldn't be an option for me because I live in the middle of nowhere and I don't have reception !!

 I don't know if GPA is calculated the same way everywhere, but here it's calculated by comparing your grades to those of your classmates, but it's very obvious some of us will be very much disadvantaged and those who live in cities/have a great connection/have the ability to learn outside of the classroom will have a great GPA. I'm so angry because going to university was the only thing keeping me hopeful at this point and now all I can think about is ''I'll never have a diploma''. I don't see the point of even going to college anymore, because even when things go back to normal, some students will have learned more than others and will already have great grades. 

I can't believe I went through all of this (therapies, constant studying, intense anxiety, crying myself to sleep) and now it's just over for me. I'll never be smart enough to achieve anything else. 

How do colleges deal with injustice like that ? Do they just let those who won't be able to keep up dealing with it themselves ?",3,1,thedandu

There’s only one class in my major that we are required to take that actually needs to be in person, which I’m currently taking. The majority of the courses for my major were online pre covid but as I’m looking through the lists for Spring 2022, almost every single one is in person! And at very similar times too. I’ve never had so many issues trying to piece a schedule together. And I only need four major electives and a minor elective (my minor elective will actually be online!) Several of these classes could easily be online. For example: History of Cinema and Social Aspects of Film. You go in, watch a movie, and go home. I took a similar course last winter and it was perfect online. I feel like they’re trying to overcompensate for all the covid stuff, but in reality is just making life a lot harder for people who can’t/don’t want to be on campus six days a week. (My school is mostly a commuter school as well)
There was two classes I really wanted to take but they were at the same time, and only one section for each. Just sucks. They only offer one class at one time and then all the other classes are the exact same way. It’ll be my last semester though and I got it worked out to where I’ll only be on campus three days a week, so not bad. Just needed to complain because online courses made it so much easier for me personally to balance, but I only saw maybe one or two online classes for my major at all when pre covid it was more 50/50.",2,1,computing-depressed

612,pl95wn,2021-09-09 23:24:13,CollegeRant,College/University experience in a Central America country and online classes.,"Hello  there. I'm what in english is call a ''freshman'', I'm at my 2nd  semester of Law and I just wanted to share my experience, or kind of a  rant, if you wish, in terms of my whole experience as a student from a  developing country

Enter a public  university in 2020, during the first few months of the year before the  COVID pandemic struck. Spend, probably, about 4 months total in  face-to-face classes. The experience was somewhat disappointing. I don't  know what it's like at other universities, but if you quickly google  what the experience is like at English-speaking universities, most of  them tend to agree that it's a bit more liberating, full of  responsibilities, but at the same time flexible and allows you to  explore and choose your dreams/interests. That's not what happened to  me. On the contrary, college feels like high school 2.0, but now on  legendary difficulty. Still, I tried my best and even became class  president during my first semester. Fast forward a bit and now we have  COVID, which forced us into one of the worst educational experiences  I've ever had in my life: online classes.

My  country has a mediocre infrastructure, but its educational system came  to the fore as soon as we were forced to change our teaching method.  Teachers, to this day, have been unable to adapt to this new environment  despite having better resources than the vast majority of students in  public universities. We have daily internet problems, sectors of cities  or towns are without power for hours, and sometimes days at a time.  Teachers don't let you make no excuses for such circumstances and blame  you if you fail to turn in your homework, assignments, exercises, and  even exams. Did your internet fail in the middle of an online test? Too  bad.

Oh, and most homework must be  done by hand. Pen and paper. And then we have to scan them somehow and  send it in. In short we do twice the work for half the reward. Well,  that's the annoying thing, but now the worst thing: the teachers are  incredibly mediocre, and this is something that worries and annoys me  seriously. Some teachers make excuses for not teaching ''Oh, my internet  is down, I won't be teaching, so I'll leave you an assignment. However,  we are not allowed to have internet failures. Somehow that is up to us  )? Incidentally, classes have become more conversations and rants about  how lazy, useless and disappointing we students are. Every day, every  class, has become a fight between teacher vs. student. Synergy is  non-existent and some teachers have told us to our faces that they have  no patience for us.

I'm honestly  thinking about dropping out of college. I don't see a future in this.  Considering that my country is incredibly corrupt, bureaucratic and  mediocre, I am beginning to seriously doubt the quality of higher  education, especially after experiencing it in person. The effort on the  part of the teachers to teach us is nil, but at the same time, I must  also place some blame on the students. I have had students begging me  directly for homework, students who never attend classes and then form  groups to pass live copies to each other during exams, or students who  prefer to take advantage of group work and do nothing. It's a horrible  experience, which I absolutely hate. Filled with depression, for the  first time I have begun to have incredibly dark thoughts about myself. I  simply want to quit all this. I don't think it's worth it, and at the  rate we're going, I think it's going to be 3 whole years of classes this  way. The damage is already done.

TL;DR:  University experience in a central american country sucks extremely.  You'll learn crap, you'll pay with your mental health, you'll have time  to do nothing and your future is uncertain unless you have someone else  to help you or offer you a job since day 1.",2,1,Endless_01

I just watched a lecture video for one of my modules tomorrow and I got a shock of my life when I found what we will be doing tomorrow! We have to create a slide and on that slide, we have to write something we admire about the person we're showing it to. And the person is a classmate after my name on the class list. For example, I'm index number 10 in class, so I have to write something for 11 and the person before me, 9, has to write something for me. If that doesn't sound awkward enough, we have to turn on our cameras, share screen (on MS Teams), read out what we wrote to the person. I could just imagine how it would be like, 2 people will turn on their cameras at a time, both the sender and recipient make awkward eye contact... Just thinking about it makes me cringe!!

Perhaps it won't play out exactly like what I thought, but I'm not doing this! There's no way in hell you could make me do this, especially since I've never interacted with 9 and 11 and in front of the whole class, HELL NO! I am going to skip class tomorrow, however, I can't think of any excuse to give the lecturer (who is my class advisor btw!). Since it's online, I can't really fake illness? My class starts at 2pm so I can't use sleeping in as an excuse. OMFG, what do I do? Does anyone have any idea?

My only solution is to join the meeting with my phone instead of my laptop because I would not be able to use PowerPoint and share screen, so that's a reason I could give for not participating tomorrow, but I would rather not go through the whole ordeal at all.

Oh yeah, tomorrow is the last day of the semester so I'm not sure if it's a good idea to skip, on the other hand, my attendance won't be affected much.",2,1,orangetree989

I have no friends I seldom leave a 12ft radius no matter how hard I work I always seem to have more work to do. I have already had to drop on class because the professor was a dumb ass. (I am not sure he knew what he was doing it was always like he was lecturing from a script, couldn't answer questions and acted holier then tho on fucking webx and in emails. 

 I have another professor who talking to is like yelling at a wall more so when you know this class is very packet tracer centered that is a rapidly compounding issue. (Network people will get how imperfect PT can be at times....)  Don't get me wrong I know that its a right of passage to work on something in PT until your eyes burn when blinking and are one ip domain-lookup (command typo) away from throwing your laptop/key bored across the room.

Then there is my ethics professor, aside from some wildly offensive and absurdly tone deaf comments in the course text book, which he ""wrote"". (I wish I could post screen caps here, not going to but wish I could.) gives us these very vague simple  instructions, then expects us to write papers that fall into this very very narrow ideal.  I just don't get what he wants, no matter what I try he just doesn't cut any slack, yes I have asked about this before. 

Now this brings be to why I am posting this here, I keep  getting emails from the enrollment coach from my major keeps emailing me wanting to know what I am going to do in order to bring my grades up. I don't know if there is anything I can do, if I just take the L I can't go back if I keep this up I am just going to get bitched at when I fail. I hate being imprisoned between a rock and a hard place, I am not going to lie it sucks not having friends or girl friend, a family who actually believes, or even professors who give a damn. I don't want to quit, I wont live my life under crushing debt working for 8.50 an hour, and never have anything other then the same hell I am in now day after day after next till it all ends. I will yield to escape such fate before that happens, I just don't know what else to do I am rapidly running out of options. The semester is almost over about a month left and this is all hitting at once because grades from the entirety of the semester are going up now.

I'm fucking doomed right now, it is 100% probability that I will be dead by the time the report card's shared. My heart's beating rapidly and I'm shaking.

1128,n8bqqx,2021-05-09 10:46:47,teenagers,Cheating in online classes,"Online classes are going on for me since the last 2 years.
At the beginning i used to read the concepts and learn things, but still i used to copy due to laziness. But then we were shifting countries (same school tho) so i used it a reason to just take a break and stop studying; Thus begins the trap. I used to try to catchup and study again, but ultimately got distracted and blamed it on syllabus because i thought i didnt understand because i didnt learn the previous lessons properly to understand this. I also got great marks by copying and it set an high standard for me, not too unbelievable since i genuinly used to study ""good"" previous years. Sometimes i wouldnt get all the answers on internet and get lower marks and i would get scolded because my marks became low (i had a test every week).

Then i went to the actual school for a brief period (covid cases decreased) and in the second week i scored a pretty good mark (it was based on new syllabus, so i didnt need to learn the previous things). I thought of using this as a step and start learning properly, when i got fever and i was sent home. I took a break of 2 days and attended online classes (they were going on simultaneously) but they were ahead. So i thought when i return to school i would just copy the notes from my friends, when the next week everyone was sent home (covid cases increased again). Then again it was the same old pain, same old guilt, but i managed to study without distraction slowly and steadily over a course of few weeks, (i also had functions in between so i would sometimes use that as an excuse to not study) and i had managed to study decently (but still copying) again when

My father got covid, and me and my mother got sick the next day (5 days ago) so i had to not attend online class again went back to square 1. It is also my last year at school which makes it even worse

I didnt know whom to tell to so i shared it here. So many ppl have high hopes on me, my parents work hard to pay my fees, but i a dumb fuk wasted all my potential. I always felt guilty, i couldnt enjoy anything, i was always surrounded by guilt wherever i went; except that brief period in school when i wrote exams without cheating...",2,1,RIRTURE

First I wanted to write the question in the chat, which I did, but the teacher did not see it. So I decided to ask the question. I was freaking nervous when I unmuted the microphone. I had the great idea to record it to see how nervous I was and really it was not that bad. I messed the question up a little bit, but the teacher still understood it. I did not sound relaxed, but I really did not seem nervous either. Maybe a bit. It was ok. I was so nervous. I learned today that I am able to act reasonably well even when I am very nervous. And that is good, because the anxiety will not disappear like that.

I am in general really surprised at what high level exposure I dare to go. Recently I talked to a group of girls, I basically just asked them how old they were and wished them a good day. The other day I shouted for a second cashieer. In front of like 30 people. Went ok again.

So that is something, but I cant deny to myself that it did not went really good either. Definetly not as good as I would like it to be. Most people are still not as socially anxious as me. And what I really want is not todo ok butdo great of course. I want to be less socially anxious than most people not the other way around",2,1,Necessary_Number

1341,mi0jvw,2021-04-01 17:36:58,AmItheAsshole,AITA for refusing to switch on my camera for online class?,"I'm a senior in highschool so since last year we had to attend online classes. Most of the teachers doesn't need us to switch on cameras unless we have an oral test or something like that, not this year or last year.

But there's one teacher, let's call him Mr. History as ge teaches history, who demands to switch on cameras, and I can't do that without disturbing others in our home. We (5 people) live in a small apartment (about 50m² ≈ 538.20 sqft) and including me there's 3 kids who attend online classes while my mom works. I don't have my own room and there's no space for me to go where I could switch on my camera without disturbing one of my family members. Even though I have a laptop which has a camera, I can't use it during these classes as it always freezes because of all the videos it has to display and I can't follow the lesson.

This far it has not been a problem. There were people who didn't switch there cameras on and there were who did, but something got to him recently and he refuses to start the lesson of there's less than 30 people in call (excluding him) and he even removes the people who are in call of the camera is not switched on. I tried to explain my situation to him but he doesn't want to understand it. Even though he said that it's hard to bring up three kids in an 50m² apartment. 

I tried to talk with my head teacher but she couldn't help me.

I attend (or at least try to if I get removed) every class and take notes, I did every assignment on time, and I'm an A student.

He also said that because of his personal privacy we can't record his lessons, take photos or anything like this. If he has these rights why can't my family have these?

He also tend to make comment on my classmates appearances (mainly the girls) who are underage (he's around 50) which could get him in serious trouble if we had some kind of evidence of this behavior and it also makes me uncomfortable and I don't want to be a target of these comments.

Mr. History also did something similar when he set up a discord server and refused to let in students who didn't have their full name as their discord user name and refused to understand that there are other servers which people might be on. When I tried to explain this he said he didn't have time for my problems and if I don't change it then I just won't be allowed to attend history classes. I went to my head teacher with some of my classmates who couldn't get in to help us (he called me (only me) out for this recently) and this time she could. But in the end he didn't do any classes and it was only ""good"" for to have confrontation with him.

Ps.: English is not my first language so something might be hard to understand but I'll try to clear everything up in the comments.",2,1,LaylaBeelzebub

1371,mfq7w8,2021-03-29 14:02:23,tifu,TIFU by milking everywhere during online class.,"Happened two months ago.

So it was the first class starting with an introduction session in which we had to introduce us. I was casually sitting on the sofa with laptop on table and was drinking milk. I had books opened beside me. So,when my turn came to introduce me, i accidentally spilled the whole glass of milk everywhere . The book was covered in milk,even my phone. But somehow laptop survived. There was much milk on the floor too. My camera was not on yet so i took the laptop and ran to other room while teacher was repeatedly saying my name and asking me to turn on my video. But at last, i was able to introduce myself successfully.

ignore the rest because i do not know why the hell does the reddit thingy does not allow me to submit a small post.i like physics mathematics and somewhat chemistry too. I would someday like to visit antarctica because i am cool. Consider me as a joke because if you are reading till here you are obviously a psychopath but why stop here lets add some more.

TL:DR:spilled milk during online class introduction ceremony. Rushed to another room",2,1,Maths___Man

A soiled 20 minutes passed by and My sister had to pick a book to read for her class.She got confused and me being the brightest star in the sky I am decided to help her.So I helped her get her answer and after that my sister couldn’t remind me she WASNT MUTED and the teacher said “good job” and of course since I’m so smart decided to say “you see I’m not a complete Idiot”thinking she WAS ON MUTE.So the teacher stated laughing and I was so embarrassed.I really hope she didn’t think I called her idiot because after that I just left.Worst Experience is with my sisters teacher.

&amp;#x200B;

This story happened a few minutes ago so I'm still very embarrassed

during online school I finished my work so I decided to watch some yt, I was watching penguinz0's video on the giant penis, and now is good time to mention that my headphones do this weird this where if the mic is took of and the mic is on mute, it will mirror the audio from my pc to google meet, discord, etc. so when I was about to start watching, I took my mic of, muted it, and started to watch yt, and proceed to forget to mute my mic in google meet making the audio mirror from my video, to the WHOLE CLASS. A few seconds in my teacher says ""could you please mute your mic \*insert my name here\*, it not appropriate for me"" to witch I quickly switched tabs to the google meet. After I muted, a friend said ""I thought it was you \*insert teacher's name here\*"" to which my teacher responded ""would I be watching a video about penises?"" making my embarrassment go up every word of that.

So the moral of the story is that if you have weird headphones that mirror your audio, don't watch weird videos if you always forget to mute your mic.

TL;DR I was watching a video about dick Olympics, forgot to mute my mic, causing my teacher to hear and have an embarrassing convo with a friend",2,4,not_gerg

I had quickly alt+tabbed to the zoom class and answered. After having made sure I didn't have to say anything else, I went back to not paying attention to the class and doing something completely different *as you do*. 

The class continued and I suddenly felt the incomprehensible urge to sing 'I love it' by Kanye West and Lil Pump while I was messing around. Thinking I was muted I started singing it while deepthroating the mic to make that oversaturared noise.

What I didn't realize was that realized my classmates were sending me tons of messages in the desperate hope of telling me my mic was on. This went on for a solid five minutes, with the teacher saying nothing. 

What made me finally realize what was going on was the teacher personally pointing it out. I can't unthink of this moment since and it haunts me to think that 30 people wotnessed my stupidity.

2585,k0vrg9,2020-11-25 16:52:10,ADHD,"I’ve experienced ADHD-PI symptoms for a long time, but I ignored them and wrote them off as results of my mild anxiety. My mom is a psychiatrist, I subtly brought it up but she said it was due to my anxiety. Now with online classes, the symptoms are getting out of hand and I don’t know what to do.","I’ve had attention and memory problems for as long as I can remember. I constantly fidget with my hands, have a difficulty organizing myself without the help of others (like friends, family, teachers, or that Google Classroom mail that reminds me of an impending deadline). I forget the things that I’m supposed to do, and even if I use a planner, I end up being too demotivated or too lost to start doing anything. These are just a mere list of what I experience. I spend most of my days inside the house and stuck in my room. Most of my room is messy, save for the parts where I lose my shit if it’s disorganized. I get distracted by simple sounds like my cat meowing in the living room or an ambulance siren that is hundreds of meters away.

At school; I had difficulty with deadlines, avoided big projects even though I knew how much of an impact it had on my overall grade, had a period where I was obsessed with my grades and did nothing else in my life but studying. Compared to my peers, I paid less importance to assignments and thought they were “easy” because I tried my best to capture all the info in class and could remember a lot of it. I never studied for exams unless it was the day before or two days before the exam. 


The reason why my mother says it’s probably anxiety is because I studied during high school and ended up in one of the best universities in the world. I also think it’s because she assumes that people with symptoms like mine cannot be smart and find ways around it. Ever since my mom said it was because of anxiety, I ignored the symptoms completely.

However, over the past couple months since my college classes started, I struggle to find the motivation to start any of my tasks since unlike physical school, I have to rely on self discipline and time management, both of which I lack. I am approximately two months behind the workload and recently missed a deadline fully knowing that it’s worth 15% of that class. The symptoms I described at the beginning of this post have worsened and I no longer know how to cope. I have no one else that I can ask for help and I’m very lost about my life. 


Someone please help me.



TL;DR The symptoms that I experience have worsened due to the lack of self discipline / difficulty with managing my time with online classes, and feeling lost in my workload. I don’t know what to do anymore. I need help but I don’t know where to seek it other than strangers on this subreddit.",2,1,linokitty

Being in a high school and typically the last year of it, has been sad overall. So ever since online classes have begun, every single class has had only some students answer or respond to the teacher while the others just take the back seat and can’t seem to care less. This is extremely unfair because the teacher is teaching the whole class and not just the 2 or 3 who actually bother to respond. Like, why care to attend the class then if you aren’t even going to pay attention? Stop wasting your parents’ hard earned money and time and energy if you’re just going to chill while not contributing shit to the class. Moreover, upon being summoned by the teacher, the audacity to lie about your mic not working but otherwise using it to speak on your private calls is just outrageous. It’s not like the students who actually answer are paid to do so, or for paying attention or something. So, yeah. Like for fuck sake, grow up and give a damn about your education... else we’ve all seen futures gone wrong. Sorry for the rant but I’m sure at some point y’all have encountered this annoying situation as well.",2,1,supershrush

2873,jqsf3w,2020-11-09 06:16:32,ADHD,The non-negotiable deadlines in online classes are killing me!,"This is going to be long-ish, so I apologize for those who have trouble reading long paragraphs. I just have no where else to vent. 

So, here's the deal: back at the beginning of the semester, I started medication and it has helped me with focusing, organizing, and getting started on work, but I still have no concept of time. Nothing I ever do is on time. It feels like time just slips through my fingers, like I can never grasp it (I have struggled with this my whole life. I remember getting yelled at my the principal in grade 4 for being late every day). Every week I tell myself I am going to improve and finally get things in on time, but every week I fail.

With in-person classes, you can show up a little late while you make last-minute adjustments to a paper, or at least plead your case with the professor in person. Just now, I typed up a well-thought out response, went to submit it, and it wouldn't let me because it was 20 minutes late. I literally can't handle this type of precision. If I get stuff in on the day it's due, it's a huge success for me, let alone an exact time. I have a chemistry class that lets you submit stuff after the time, though you may get a few marks off because it's late. That class has been a godsend for me (93 percent in it currently).

Don't even get me started on the tests. The tests actually have a timer counting down on the bloody screen, and when I'm doing stuff that requires calculations, it makes me extremely nervous. The last test I did, despite being comfortable at home and knowing how to do the math, I completely froze when I saw the timer and thought about how it was worth 15% of my mark. I started shaking, blanked out, and could not think to do the equations, so I don't even know what I wrote down, and I never finished the last questions. I tanked.

I'm going to try and set up an appointment with accommodations (it took me several weeks to get a doctor's note), but I feel stressed and intimidated about the whole thing, especially because I still have to email all 6 professors with the form and see what they are willing to help with and I should have done it at the beginning of the semester (late again!). I feel embarrassed about it all. 

I really love learning. I love what I'm doing, except for the deadlines. But my health is going down the drain. I'm not getting proper sleep. I'm not getting exercise. My hair is thinning. I'm too old for this shit (29 and back in school, and I definitely feel it compared to my early 20s). Does anyone have any tips for dealing with time blindness/being extremely slow? I keep thinking of all the money invested in this, and I can't blow it like I've done before. I'm already in debt from before. This is it for me.",2,1,aryastark2888

Somebody once told me

The world was gonna roll me

My teacher eventually (I had gotten to 'In the shape of an L') told me to stop unless I was doing it in French. So naturally, I did what he said. I don't remember much French from last year, so I typed a couple lines into Google Translate and (even though I know it got 'forehead' wrong) started pasting the translations in chat. I laughed even harder, and eventually had to give up from laughting too hard, soi went back to my lesson.

In each one, I found that I was usually one of the few to keep the camera on and consistently contribute. The only time this was not the case was when the professor asked everyone to put cameras on or called upon certain people. Whenever there's an awkward pause, I'm 100% the first one to break it and say something to help move the discussion along. Is this the case with anyone else?

Another example was on Canvas the teacher asked us to introduce ourselves with either a text or video. Out of over 40-50 responses, I was the literal only one to make a video of myself. If you scroll through a wall of text, you'll see my video! LMAO.

When i am feeling unmotivated in watching lectures or doing things I have found that fixing how they appear can really make a difference. 

Ex) i got a new pen that is specifically for my planner and a new set of brush pens as when i ""cross things out "" I like to basically highlight it in a color code like green for done or orange for due soon in a way that what is written is still legible. 

Also when taking notes on onenote- if i am feeling burnt out with a class i switch the color im writing with to something else that is still legible but will refresh the experience of writing things down.

Finally INVEST IN BLUE LIGHT GLASSES. The eye strain is real since we are all basically on our computers all the time now. You may not notice it now but once you have them you wont want to work without them. Amazon has cute ones for like $8, it is worth it just to try.

I plucked in my earphone in the laptop to speak anything and at that time my mic created a very short but loud distortion sound. So then I almost instinctively decided to ferociously plug and unplug the earphone continuously and it kept creating the same distortion.

In that class, there was no lecture at all, all we were given were some files to read. In our first assignment, we had to do an essay, and I got so much stress from not having enough knowledge to write it. I spent so much time on Google, yet still not understand enough to write. 

It was just so horrible that I had to end up dropping that class (yesterday). 

I lost an amount of money from Financial Aid due to dropping. 

Imagine paying for ~$200 for that class, getting 70% refund back, but also losing an another 25% from Financial Aid. (Seriously, why do they have to cut that much just because of dropping class?)

It does hurt to see a huge balance in my account, but I believe I have no regret. I would rather lose an amount of money that I could try working for a few extra weeks for, than waste time getting stress yet still have low GPA.",2,1,duckie_123

3682,ilwf9y,2020-09-03 16:10:38,college,"covid, going home, online classes, ETC (any thoughts please)","so i've been at school (in nyc) for some time now and a lot of people think that no matter what, colleges are going to close anyway because students can't stop fucking partying. already on my schedule of what were supposed to be fully in person classes, all of my classes but one have gone online and the one that is in person still, i will actually only attend in person 3 times total this semester because students are on an in person rotation due to room size covid limits. 

i was upset for a bit about this but i can't change it so i'm honestly just sucking it the fuck up rn, even though i'm really upset that i am paying full tuition (paying of loans without the help of anyone, no complaints but it's a lot of money for online school when i additionally hate being here). 

honestly, i'd be even more okay with this if i could have the choice to go home since i also have some mental health issues and am finding it extremely difficult to find a healthy routine when i can't even walk to class (seriously screw my bitchass roommate) and have zero spaces to myself. nothing would change academically but i'd be going to class in a city i like and would be able to be far more healthy.

my parents say that i committed to this so i have to stay here, but i committed to in person classes and that was the reason i was okay with going so far. plus they're not the ones paying the tuition.

please give any thoughts you have. doesn't even have to be advice. just looking for insight.",2,1,lilyrh

Now I may be an introvert and nearly crap my pants when I need to approach someone I don't know, but for some reason I am actually good at public speaking.  So our group didn't do ANYTHING, we read the paper and didn't discuss it at all, so when we needed to share what we talked about there was silence for like 30 seconds and the teacher kept asking us to say something.  Eventually I opened up the assignment and unmuted my mic, I then proceeded to pick random pieces from the article and explain why it was important, I was able to get 4 things and come up with reasons for the importance of those.  The teacher didn't suspect a thing and said I did a really good job.  I then went back to watching youtube while the other groups shared.",2,2,cycodude_boi

I am a college English instructor and will be teaching all online this Fall. Online is still new to me and I want to make sure my students' needs feel heard/ my goal every semester is to not lose any students (i.e. they stop attending or quit). I tried googling to figure out/anticipate what will be the biggest struggles and best supports in online classes, but had a hard time. Textbooks about online teaching always seem hokey to me or unrealistic (e.g.""have students make intro videos with bitmojis and complete daily discussion boards"". Like, nah, i don't want to read daily journals or make students record themselves?). I can only really go based on my experiences taking online in undergrad. Would you mind letting me know then:

* How do you learn best in an online class? What could an instructor do to help you succeed? (do you like check-ins, discussion boards, video conferences, reminder emails, etc?)
* What is the most difficult part for you? (motivation, staying on task, understanding content, interaction, etc?)

So, I'm currently in the last year of high school and we've been taking classes online for a long time. During these classes, the teachers ask the questions and I am one of the students who likes to answer, because it facilitates my learning. Often my microphone locks up and the teacher doesn't understand what I say, so it happens often in class. 

The day is today, I'm in math class with my boomer teacher and I'm listening to ""Walk 'em Down"" by NLE Choppa on my headphones as I write down what he says. In the middle of that, the teacher asks a question and I open the microphone to answer, but I saw that he changed his facial expression as if he didn't understand, so I opened the chat and sent a message that my microphone freezes many times, apologized and then I muted my microphone.

After a while I looked at my phone and saw that I had more notifications than usual. When I opened it, I saw a video that my friend sent me in which the song I was listening to was coming out of my microphone at full volume, so the teacher and all my classmates were listening to the song I was listening and nothing that I said. I'm lucky because he knows I contribute to the class, otherwise he probably would have kicked me out of the class lmao.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR; Was listening to hip hop during class and and the song was passing from my headphones to my microphone as I tried to answer a question",2,1,LucasSkudy

4719,gf3ki3,2020-05-07 09:45:42,tifu,TIFU by accidentally posting a picture in an online class chat.,"So, some context. I am a teen and used to go to high school. With the new virus going around we have online lessons now. Most of my classmates are slacking off except me and two girls.  We were messing around in chat by using filters and stuff like that. I was trying to get cat ears on my self so we all would have cat years. My Ipad lagged out like crap and the whole thing went really bad. One of the girls told me I was accidentally taking pictures and I pressed cancel as soon as possible. So, the clicks from the lag were stored and reapplied when the Ipad stopped lagging. I got the cat ears and the lesson went normally.

After the lesson ended, one of the girls messaged me and told me to delete the picture. I was confused and then it hit me. I checked the message board and there it was. It was a picture of her and I internally started to panic. She asked me to delete it, but messenger doesn't allow you to delete messages after a certain time passes.

I tried explaining and apologized to her for doing it and explained what happened and that it was an accident. She said it was fine and that she wasn't angry. I still feel bad about it.

The picture in itself wasn't bad. She looked normal and just had cat ears on.

Question: how many of you came expecting it to be a DK PIC?

TL;DR Took a normal picture of a girl during an online class by accident and posted it. She didn't appreciate it.",2,1,Nika13k

I won't specify the whole concept, but I'm planning to write a blog entry of how could it work. 
Me and my english teacher, as well as some of my friends are in advance english class group. I sent there my whole concept, along with screenshots of the concept server I've made and explained why is it better idea then Viber or Google Classroom. Unfortunately thought, nothing will be changed now since we are too deep into the quarantine and classes and school is almost over, however, she may use this concept for some other time like this. I will cite her response:

""I don't think I'm going to change anything now but it might be useful for the future lessons. I am counting on you to explain all the details when the time comes.""

I feel so proud of my achievement.
Oh yea, and also, I will edit this post once I write the blog to give you the template for the server and the link to how the concept is supposed to work.",2,1,OnlyOneFaz

4889,g9yzer,2020-04-29 00:12:32,OSU,I honestly prefer some aspects of online classes,"While having all online classes has been pretty terrible in general, there are two main things involving them that I really appreciate and hope are continued post-COVID:

1. **Accessing lectures online whenever you want is great.** I personally had a hard time focusing during the time for classes or certain instructors would go too fast for me to take useful notes. Being able to access lecture when I need it the most and when my brain is functioning has been great, especially in math (professor recorded himself explaining review material). My calculus class in highschool recorded all of his classes and we had a great AP test pass rate. I'm hoping professors consider recording their in-person lectures even after COVID.
2. **Virtual office hours are great**. Honestly, I think they have helped me just as much as normal office hours have and they don't require me to actually go somewhere. I think continuing virtual office hours instead of or alongside in-person office hours would be great. The professor and student don't need to go anywhere and the hours can be just as helpful.

I think that keeping these aspects of online classes around would really benefit the students and make the university better overall.",2,1,HaupiaBoy2

Now me being the idiot I am, I thought when I woke up it would be Wed 29 April. Now since online school starts for me on the 29th, I set an alarm for 6 am, got up, ate and sat down at my laptop. For my first period we have a zoom class that starts at 8 am. I put the zoom code in and waited, and waited for class to start. I sent an email to my Period 1 teacher about the non working zoom code and asked for another one. She did not reply so i thought my internet had a problem like it usually does. I reset  the modem and still no luck getting into the zoom class. I then got really bored and browsed my phone. I was waiting for about 40 mins for my zoom class in all, and in those 40 mins i went to check the time, and saw that is was still the 28th of April, not the 29th as i thought it would be.

So immediately, I hopped into bed confused and pissed off to make up for my crappy sleep.

I’ll try to keep it short.

I’m currently on year 3 of my community college with 3 semesters to go before I transfer (hopefully). However, my physics professor’s online class plan is “read these chapters on your own”. Well fuck me... I don’t know how to do the beginning physics stuff because I was suppose to go to tutoring but that’s closed now.

I also have my chemistry class which I kinda stopped checking online because I’ve been so distracted.

So I was thinking to at least drop my physics class and attempt my chemistry since I was diagnosed with ADHD yesterday, I am now trying treatment, I’m sure I can handle at least 1 class. 

However, this means I’m going to be set back an extra 2 semesters since the university I’m aiming for only accept transfers in the fall, so I don’t get delayed by 6 months. I get delays by a year...

However! Thanks to an awesome program I can take those university classes while I’m in my community college. But I have no idea how to explain this to my family...

My GF would not want me to just drop this semester essentially since I’m already so delayed compared to my friends. An telling my family involves me telling them I have ADHD which they will not believe is a real thing... situation sucks all around. No idea what to do right now.",2,6,Account2Discuss

5520,fsevs6,2020-03-31 15:26:59,teenagers,A teenager's guide to surviving online class,"As we all know, many schools are held over inline platforms like Zoom or Webex or a whole host of other things. Despite the advantages which digital classes presents during the pandemic, the extended time on screen can have negative effects on physical and mental health. Compounded by the lack of community we experience due to “shelter in place”, this can end up being pretty detrimental. This should hopefully serve as a guide to minimize the negative effects of Zoom classes. Of course, I don’t pretend to speak for all situations/schools (because different teachers, homes can present different methods of dealing), but this is a system which my friends and I have come up with for decreasing negative effects of online classes.

1.      Wake up earlier than you need. This helps with a lot of things. First off, you will be more awake for class. Get up and go jogging, for instance, so that you will be less tired when you’re sitting down in a chair for many hours. Also, once life gets back to normal, you won’t be used to sleeping in till 7:30, when you normally have to get up at 6:30.

2.      Use a smaller screen: using a cell phone to call into class reduces screen usage because, of course, you are using less of a screen! It seems like a small difference, but it really helps.

3.      Get up between classes or during lunch. Get outside! Most schools have some amount of outside space which you will find yourself in during the day, and so you get more natural vitamin-whatever. Be sure to replicate this at home.

4.      Don’t use headphones: I fully understand that some classes and systems are much better when you have headphones, but if there’s the option, letting the sound be part of the ambient noise, and not putting it directly into your ear is healthier.

5.      Catch up with friends! Community is tremendously important to mental health. Zoom calls under 40 minutes are free to set up, so meet up with the boys during lunch or after school. You’ll be glad you did.

6.      Keep your camera on, and your mic off. You have a lot of noise going on around you that your classmates don’t want to hear. However, they do want to see you. You matter! Also, when your camera is on, you are visible to others, and so you have an impetus to be more engaged. Again, it seems weird, but it helped us a lot!

That’s all I have for y’all, but please feel free to add advice of your own in the comments. This post is not meant to bash Zoom, or any of the other platforms which are stepping up to help schools and students during this unfortunate crisis. I’m just a teenager trying to help out my fellow students during this new situation. Stay healthy y’all!",2,2,Geometris

5682,fpmek5,2020-03-26 23:44:24,college,Unhelpful professor during online class,"So I’m taking an Advanced Analytical Methods class and we are doing problems associated with “Linear Programming”. 

We started off learning how to do it with two variables and did an excel problem where he taught us how to set it up with two variables. 

However we are doing problems with a lot more variables and he never taught us how to do those problems in excel. So he assigns us a problem to do on excel and we don’t know how to set it up. 

Once online classes started he pushed the due date back. So I emailed him about how to set it up and the professor responds back with “it’s the same way we set it up with two variables”. Which makes no sense because there are multiple variables and it’s a totally different kind of question from what we did with two variables. 

So I learned how to do the problem myself and the setup was *completely different*

I’m scared that if he assigns more excel assignments he’s not going to answer how to set up a question that we haven’t learned how to do and I don’t want it to negatively effect my grade. 

TL;DR: professor is assuming I don’t know how to work excel and is basically giving me the basics on how to solve those kind of problems in excel when in reality I need to know how to setup the problem because he never taught us it.",2,1,TurnerK28

I’m already very stressed as things are as I’ve never used Zoom before and I am really bad with technology, which is already hampering my teaching.

On Friday, I was especially frustrated because my laptop froze and things were just not going well for me personally either, nor in the classroom, so I told all of the former students hanging out in the call to hang up and leave and not contact me for the rest of the school year and that I would be talking to my current students about not giving out Zoom links to their friends/my former students.

5940,flfr3h,2020-03-19 19:11:14,teenagers,Am I the only one who doesn't open their facecam in the online class?,"Hi

I live in Hong Kong and study in a Local School (for now), which was started quarantine from Feb 1 (although Lunar new years holiday started Janurary 21 to Feb 2) and I havent attended IRL school in ~2 months now. (Yes us hong kongers miss school a lot.) Our classes started on 2nd of March, and in the beginning 1~2 people (usually me) open their webcams at times, but now no one even does anymore.

In my classes conducted with Zoom, when we get into the room everyone shuts off their webcam and microphone with only the teacher talking and showing his/her screen while teaching us. So far only one of my teachers actively ask us questions (my english teacher) in which when she calls our names we un-mute our mic, answer, and then mute the mic.

 Our chatbox has 0 chatter (except for me and my crush (who already friendzoned me) making memes cuz we're more “Western cultured” than my classmates) and no webcams (except for my liberal studies teacher) are opened. 

We literally just sit there, watching our screen and listening to my teacher speak while he/she draws notes on his/her screen and we follow. Literally 0 discussion occurs (not that there is much in our normal classes anyways) When the free 40min Zoom session ends we just get kicked out of the lesson.

Ive browsed reddit for quite a bit now and these days i notice a lot of online class webcam memes. I could not relate to them in the deepest level. Does anyone else share my thoughts? Or is it just me?

At first, I thought he was joking so I didn't take it too seriously but then after we finished classes, he asked us to open up our cams and sing one by one. I couldn't because my laptop's an ASUS ROG Strix that doesn't have a cam but I think he saw that as an excuse so I wouldn't have to.

 The first girl sang, then the second, and finally me. What's more was that he was recording it. While everyone was having a good laugh, I was panicking, saying ""fuck fuck fuck"" over and over again then finally had the courage to message my teacher, ""Sir, I have social anxiety. Please don't do this to me."" I thought he'd actually be kind enough to let me be but instead he encouraged me to sing even more by putting the spotlight on me. I bet you can already guess what's going on through my mind that moment. Yep, it wasn't pretty. Like, he think he's helping by saying stuff like ""It's okay. You need to overcome things like these."" but it's not that easy at all! 

I was on the verge of sending him another message that says this is not part of the lesson ergo I'm not obligated to partake in this tradition but stopped myself since I thought that would be kinda rude, especially when this is literally my first time meeting him. And so, my strategy was to mute myself, wait for a few minutes until time runs out and eventually, it worked! He called my name numerous times but instead of responding, I just sat down on the chair and ate pizza to calm myself down. I can tell by the way the teacher looked that he was disappointed and it was painfully obvious that the mood died down because of me. Now I'm getting nervous for our next meeting.",1,1,everydayis_wenday

I can focus very well in the face to face lesson week with my Vyvanse 50mg, so I think my dosage is perfectly fine.  


However in online class, eventho its the same kind of lessons like in the face to face classes, I am not able to focus at all.  
I am craving the dopamine so hard at home, that I can resist focusing on something else for like 1 minute but then I fall for it and find myself browsing on reddit.   


We are now switching to 100% online class so I'm a bit worried that I wont be able to stay on the track with all the big chunks of information I have to learn each week.  
 until now it was okay that I wasnt able to focus in online class, because I could catch up that week in the face to face classes.

Never took any. My husband is currently in training to receive a qualification for his workplace. Normally this takes place in person but due to covid it's happening via zoom meetings now, which isn't great for my husband as he's horrible with tech. Doesn't even own a smartphone.

We live in a small studio apartment. Think one big room plus bathroom. 

As the class runs from 8 till 12 and I'm home in that timeframe, we set up a curtain in the corner to divide the room a bit and give him privacy so he can learn without distractions. I thought this was a great idea. 

Turns out, his teacher does not think it's a great idea. At first, everything went as planned - my husband actually managed to log into the meeting and was able to use camera and mic, but then he fiddled around with the mic settings in windows and accidentally muted himself. He called me over to help, as he had no idea what to do. I ducked behind the curtain, waved 'hi' to the class and teacher to be polite, quickly reset everything and went away again. Didn't think anything of it.

In the afternoon, he got a mail from the teacher. She told him she expects him to be alone in a room when the class takes place, and if that's not possible due to space restrictions he would need to make sure I stay somewhere else during class as I am not a (paying) participant or he stays somewhere else.

He checked back with his company and they largely agree I cannot be in the same room. I find this very odd, to say the least. Not sure what to do now.

182,scxy6g,2022-01-26 05:05:09,ADHD,I hate online classes (rant),"As the title says, I hate online classes (we all do). Very much that I feel like I’m gonna have a mental break(dance).

With ADHD, concentrating in online classes just feels impossible. In fact, it’s like I don’t even want to. When I was in high school (1-2 years ago), I used to get into the zoom meeting and switched to play video games/leave my chair to grab a lunch instead of listening to the lecture, or just sit in front of the screen without listening to anything because I kept zoning out.

At first, changing into online school felt interesting and fun. It’s also because I was still in high school though. But the thing is, when I got into college last year, and the class were all in-person, I felt so much alive. Now that we’re going back to online classes, I don’t know what to say. Everything feels like despair, especially when you have homeworks and things to think and learn about. It’s so frustrating. I want to actually learn something from the classes but sitting in front of my laptop, listening to someone talking for hours, just doesn’t work for me. And I’m currently unmedicated. I’m still waiting for a new medication since the last one gave me some side effects.

I’m still lucky that there’s still some hope to get back into in-person classes next month, unless they extend it again..",1,1,Due_Contribution7911

I'm 18f, indian and my house is not peaceful. There is always something or the other happening and it's very loud. I am not kidding you, it is very loud and causes me a lot of trouble while trying to attend online classes. 

We have a spare room but my brother uses it for his online classes and is pretty adamant on staying alone there. I tried communicating with my mom but she shouted at me, she shut me down. I don't fucking know what to do. 

Aita for asking her to make the kids in the house stfu and try to maintain peace? I have tried talking to my aunt but she doesn't do anything because kids will make noise and i have to deal with it. 

We had a fight a few minutes ago and she isn't speaking to me. And no, i don't have a lawn or terrace where i can go, neither do I live in a big mansion. Also, i do not have any friends so i can't really go to anyone's house. I mean my friends do not live nearby. I can't go out of the house because my parents think I'm trying to become too independent since I've gotten into college. 

I don't mind the noise, but when it's my turn to interact with the class, they start saying some nasty stuff or idk, they're judgemental people and my aunt and mom are always gossiping. 

If any Indian is seeing this, do you have any advice on how to move out etc. I have other reasons to move out as well. And i live in a metropolitan city of this country, so it may get a little difficult to convince my parents. 

But how can I reconcile with my mother and make her understand?? She gets fucking defensive when I say anything about those kids. She obviously prefers my brother or those young kids over me.",1,1,thrownnymous

Corona rules have made this tough - most language schools have moved to online-only, which I find difficult for language learning.

I recently found an in-person class for my level. All participants are required to be vaccinated. One student in the class is not vaccinated, and has been given permission to participate via Zoom.

The teacher is not especially tech-savvy, so we always lose some time due to technical setup issues for the benefit of this one remote participant. Also, because of the nature of the setup, this person frequently interrupts everyone else. (I'm not blaming the person -- the speaker is just loud, and I have no idea if they can hear the rest of the class very well.)

I find this to be incredibly distracting, and am considering writing to the school to complain. Am I wrong for being annoyed by this?

My reasoning is that anyone who wants to get vaccinated can do so for free -- as far as I know, there is no medical issue here. Also, there are many, many online classes available, but very in-person options. I signed up for this class specifically because I don't want to deal with online participants.",1,1,JoeyJoeJoeJrShab

And then, my Zoom account wasn’t set up with my school account, which usually doesn’t matter, but of course today it did, so I couldn’t join the meet.

This is my first semester of a 4-year program, and I’m honestly regretting even going to a 4-year school if this is what all the instructors are like (I’ve only had one instructor that didn’t make me socialize constantly). Basically, what I’ve learned is if you have social anxiety, don’t be a studio art major because it’s nonstop socializing and no one cares about or accommodates social anxiety. And honestly, this semester hasn’t been great for my depression either, so fuck me I guess. I don’t know if this sounds stupid or not, but I’m just very frustrated right now.

So my online lectures starts at 8 in the morning, and I'm a night king, staying up late until 2 AM is my thing, as you can guess I wouldn't be able to wake up early, have breakfast or shower before my class starts, mostly I do it all during lecture times, (not shower, just breakfast and tea. They almost never ask for camera to be turned on, I turn on my mic occasionally to be able to answer some questions and simple yes/no things.

It comes today, I wake up at 8:05, no problem, I would just join the link and while others join, I would go make tea, and come back. I do that just to come back to my teacher screaming for everyone to turn their camera on, or they would kick us out of meeting, I thought, ""okay, I would just do that, I wouldn't be noticeable in between 50 other students. I open my physical privacy shutter on my laptop and turn my meet camera on, to my fear, I had a bright yellow background which I last used while playing around myself and experimenting that feature, then I realize I yet have to turn camera privacy mode off in software to show myself, in 3-5 second of my doing that everyone's brain get attracted to my camera's yellow screen and no me. Then I appear on it like magic, in my nightdress, not showered, not drunk tea, just my natural face with my eyes adjusting to bright screen, slightly scared as I thought everyone's attention point must be myself. Yes that was true, it went silence for 2 seconds, and then following conversation took place,

T: Hey mmmmmjjjrrrrr, I'm asking YOU

M: *in my not so loud embarrassed voice,* ""Yes sir""

M: Yes sir

T asking to other boy who haven't yet turned on camara:  Hey rrrrr, where are you?

I am considering to drop out of school since my university won't allow major change nor dropping of subjects. I just want justice to be served and for someone to stand up for these students as the lecturers and management kept saying ""do not let this goes viral""",1,1,Educational_Area_750

I was in a class with about 20 people and the teacher was going on and on about something and I was bored. So I thought of watching a movie and I saw the button saying ""Screen Share"" and I thought it was an easy way to separate my screen into two (like multitasking). So I clicked it and instead of separating, they gave me an option to choose which page I wanted to open, so I opened up Peaky Blinders and watched for about two minutes until I realize the class had gone very quiet. Welp, I was playing the movie for everyone.

The only thing that keeps me unembarrassed in that class anymore is the fact that I didn't put up a scene where someone was having sex.

1658,li9kno,2021-02-12 11:54:33,tifu,"TIFU by telling my classmate, we can present next in an online class","It´s a pretty basic FU, which I would imagine alot of people can relate to, and could maybe stop you from embarassing yourself, or even suffering bad consequences.  
Anyway, lets skip to the FU. Today (in fact just 15 minutes ago) I had an online class, where we are supposed to learn some pretty basic communication skills in english, that are helpful in the profession, im aspiring to work. It is important to state, that all my classes are mandatory, because we get paid during the time we are studying.   
The problem about the english classes are, that they are super basic. While im not an english genius by any means, im usualy able to communicate without major issues. So obviously I started a game during the lecture, that would keep me busy for a bit, while still being able to follow the lecture on the side.   


About 5 minutes into the lesson our tutor decides she wants to do some breakout-sessions (we are using ZOOM for our lectures) with us, in which we shall prepare a description of a well known person and prepare it to the class afterwards.   
So while playing I discuss which person to take, and how we can split it up, with my assigned partner.   
He was supposed to describe the appearance, while i focus on the professional career of the person.   


Everything goes smoothly, and before reconnecting I tell him we have to let some other people go first, since im still caught up in this godforsaken game, my mates werent willing to finish.  


Now here comes the FU... Usually in a Zoom Meeting there is the option to have a private chat, if you double click on the colleagues name. Appearently though, this is a feature you can disable, so the only Chat that is available is the ""All-Chat"" everyone can see. You can see where this is going by now.   
After finishing the game, i wrote my colleauge ""We can present now, I finished that stupid game"". It took like 10 seconds for my phone to blow up from Whatsapp messages my class send, and another 10 seconds for our teacher to call me out for sending a very ""interesting"" message.   
I instantly went red, started sweating and had that laugh you have, when you know you cant change a really awkward situation you put yourself in.  


Luckily our teacher was fairly understanding, as I explained we finished our task so fast, that I decided to start a quick round of online chess, which dragged on for longer than anticipated. We presented our results instantly after the mishap, and I think she just glanced over it, but holy moly that short adrenaline rush, combined with my classmates now making fun of me for about 20 minutes straight might have been the most exciting, yet embarassing thing happening to me in the last few weeks.   


So remember guys: Always check the recipient of your ZOOM messages, as the option to have a private chat, can be easily disabled!  


TLDR: Wanted to tell a colleague I finished my game and we can present next. Instead told the whole class, including the teacher and got called out for playing games during the lecture. No bad consequences tho. (I hope)",1,1,Frednex

But then everything switched to online and the quality of the class changed. We didn’t have class anymore, my professor would just send us problems to do.

No idea what my grade on the final or any of the homeowners was.

I barley remember anything form the second half of the class. Really I didn’t know wtf was even going on then.

I can't take it in the fall because classes I have to take conflict with it.

I want to take it, but it seems like the cons out-weight the pros.

The problem:

I live off campus and taking this class would meaning having to go to campus for an online class that's before the in person one. I can't get to campus in the fifteen minute time period between the two classes.  

The only place that's open is the library and the online class isn't a lecture. It's one where I'm going to be participating in discussions and reading stuff out loud. The in person class ends at 9pm and I have to be at campus the next day for a 9am class. My campus is not the safest place at night and the surrounding area definitely is not safe.

This class is only one day a week, but I feel like it's more of a hassle than it's worth.

Is it weird to ask for a recommendation letter from an online class?,"I graduated years ago from undergrad with an unrelated major. So I don't feel that it is appropriate to ask a professor that probably forgot about me. After graduated I was self-employed for 50% and then employed elsewhere. (Again unrelated jobs too) 

My last employer ended awkwardly because they didn't believe the seriousness of COVID from the start. Even in the beginning when the science was uncertain, they persisted for me to work despite the fact that I came back from a trip from Spain right before things shut down where I live (California) and the fact that my grandma and dad both got COVID (they don't live with me though)... They kept saying it's no big deal even when I was sick (not with COVID).. I worked in a job where you touch patients and are basically in the same bubble and in a small space with no good airflow. They did not provide any masks or protective equipment for employees.

I quit the job. Took a couple months to reflect and then got back into classes to explore if I wanted to pursue a different career path. I took 4 design classes from UCLA but they were all online and not synchronous (so no Zoom class). I am thinking about maybe 2 of them might be open to it, I got good grades, participated the most in the discussion boards, etc... but it feels awkward since they never have seen me in a video call.. what should I do?  should I wait a year to apply and try to sign up for classes that are scheduled zoom times? I am applying for HCI and UX programs which take into account gpa and portfolio, as well.

TLDR; graduated college years ago and need recommendation letters for a masters program. last employer was myself and someone else that ended awkwardly. I can maybe ask from a professor that I took an online class but never had to video chat. what should I do? maybe they are more lenient with requirements because of covid?",1,1,CreativePlant7

The teacher asks the class a question and our class needs to take turns talking. After I spoke I forgot to mute my mic becuz my friends kept yelling.

Then I tell them to shut the fuck up and starts to play “Die Very Rough” on my speaker becuz we’re playing hide and seek in CS:GO. My speaker yells out the lyrics ''i’m a big dog, big bear, ni*gga, I’m a lion. I’m the predator of the prey that is hiding.... don’t you run from me lil ni*gga”

Then my teacher starts to yell after me and I realized I fucked up. The whole class and my friends is dying of laughter. I’m stupid.

This happened about 3 hours ago.

I have my sanskrit language classes thrice a week and it sometimes gets really annoying. I am an extremely anxious person and when she (our teacher) asks us to recite the shlokas(poetic writing in sanskrit) I lose it. Skribbl i do know each of them I can't recite them when I know that there are lots of other kids listening to me speak.
So what happened is that without knowing that my mic was on (is kept on by default) I sent a voice message to my friends saying""I can't f*cking do this anymore, I hate sanskrit classes"". Well my teacher heard me say that and so did most of my classmates. I want very surprised when my parents received a call from her a few minutes after class had ended.

So I was really tired and nothing really important was being taught, so i decided to sleep during that class. Now I am 100% sure that I had kept my camera off before going to sleep, but lo and be hold about 45 mins later, i wake up and see that tiny flash next to my web cam, and i see that my camera has been turned on, now i dont know how long it was turned on for but i immediately placed my finger on the webcam and turned it off, and left the meeting in embarrassment.  
But then I remembered that while i was turning off my camera, I couldn't clearly see myself of my surroundings, so i decided to turn on my camera (I turned on my camera in the camera app, not zoom) and it was completely dark because my lights were off to help me sleep better.  
But here's the thing, the class started in early evening, when there's enough sunlight to make me visible on camera, but after around 30-40 mins,my camera could not see me or my surroundings. I am hoping that the camera was accidentally turned on at a later time and no one could see me.  
Oh well if they could see me, i am sure i will be getting a call after the classes are over :(

I had even prepared some things to say. Now because of some assholes who can’t stay at home we’ve had to move to digital classes FOR THE SECOND TIME since this semester started. First of all I will not be able to talk to anyone for at least two weeks and by then I will have to start all over again because all of my progress will have gone away. It’s so hard in the beginning. I don’t know if I can do it all over again. Second of all I learn so much better when the teacher is there in person and I can hear other students discussing problems and sometimes partake in those discussions (if they’re in small groups). Third of all zoom classes are the worst. I had a zoom class last week where we had to discuss problems and I completely froze up. I couldn’t say a word and got horrible anxiety. In person interactions are so much less painful.

I was having online classes regularly (First year second meeting) until my kinda let’s just say not so serious friend invited me into a discord. Hes the type of friend most movies display as the bad influence. For context this was my first time for online classes everrr so I had no idea how zoom exactly works. I know the basics of course just like join mute and shit like that. At first I was reluctant to join making some bullshit excuses that my laptop was too slow for discord, saying it wouldn’t launch cos I KNEW THIS WOULD GO WRONG. He kept insisting I join the voice chat. So I joined talking about how I’ve been and stuff like that just catching up normal stuff. This was going for like 10 mins until I was for some reason booted of the zoom call. So I joined back in nothing out of the blue and then I STARTED TALKING SHIT about how useless the subjects and the first meeting was. It was already the second meeting and she was basically explaining the syllabus. This went for a solid 5 mins talking about it. I didn’t really talk shit about the teacher or my classmates but this is my first time I really fucked up in front of a whole bunch of people. Thank god I’m not blockmates with the majority except 1. It might not be as bad but I have literally been dying from second hand embrassment since it happened. Lastly for context I am a super shy person who literally has to hype himself  up and panic about introducing themselves.

TL;DR I basically talked shit unmuted in the online class",1,1,carlo626

I don’t have air conditioning and covid means I can’t really go to some air conditioned place. I completely flopped my homework and such and got an A grade on the final, but failed the course overall.

I lied to myself this whole time I had done well, but now that I’ve seen the grade, I’m panicing. I’m panicing and I just anxiety dropped a class I’ve procrastinated the most in.

I’m really afraid for my future. I want to go to law school I realized, but right now I’m so damn afraid I’m just not going to cut it because I can’t salvage my grades.

3171,j6s4nq,2020-10-07 14:45:09,teenagers,I missed two online classes today.,"So basically, I was doing all virtual classes this year until Monday of this week. Now I'm in hybrid classes, which means I'm in a group that goes to school on Mondays and Thursdays and stays virtual for the rest of the week. There are two other groups, one group goes to school on Tuesdays and Fridays, and the other that stays virtual the entire week. Today is the only day that all groups are virtual. 

Before Monday, classes started at 9 AM. Since I had study hall for my first period, I started classes at 10 AM. Now, first period starts at 7:30, meaning I start at 8:34. For some reason, I thought that since today was the only all virtual day, the classes would follow the prior virtual schedule. I was wrong obviously. At the time my first class started, I was on the road to my mother's house with my Dad. 

I only realized my mix up 30 minutes ago when I tried logging into my 2nd period Google Meeting. There was no code posted so I asked my friend from the class what was up. That's when I found out for sure that I had missed an entire class. 

I have a solution though, I'm gonna email the teachers of the classes that I missed and tell them that I had technical difficulties. I'll finish the work that I need to do first, then I'll email. Fortunately, both the teachers are pretty chill and I think they'll understand. I would tell them the truth but then if my mother finds out she'll scream, yell and, threaten me like she always does. I really don't want to have that sort of thing happen again even though it happens like every day I'm with her.

Thanks for listening.

So anyway here's the deal - my online class starts at 9 and goes on till 5. With 1 hour break from 1 to 2 for lunch. So essentially, I barely get time to do anything.

But the good part is we do not need to turn on our video or audio during the classes so I could just about do anything when the class is going on unless the teacher specifically asks someone to answer a question or if you have doubts.

I wake up at around 8:30, do my business and then sit down for classes until lunch. Today I woke up a bit late - 8:50 and directly joined the class. At around 10 I realized I haven't pooped or brushed so I take my phone in to listen to what's going on (just in case the teacher decided to call out my name) and I sit down to well.. do the deed.

So after it's done I put my phone down to ... well you know... (okay this is still super embarrassing why did I even decide to put it on the internet) and accidentally turned on the audio. Now I didn't realize that and my whole class heard me flush the toilet.

And the thing is, I still didn't realize what was happening so I wash my hand (all the while singing 'You belong with me' by Taylor Swift), brush my teeth and picked up my phone to see what was happening. After I realized what had happened, I exited from the meeting and didn't join again.

I am still too too embarrassed to check my texts from my classmates. Dear lord I never wanna go back to school.

But from what I gather, everyone thought it was hilarious.

And now I do triple checks to make sure my audio and video is switched off.

She always shouts and whenever she starts shouting most of the time is spent in that. One has to close one's ears when she starts shouting.

My friend, let's call him Jay, joined the class just for attendence. He handed me his phone during his turn for Pics. And after that I handed it back to him as I was the next one. He starts telling me while my photos are being taken how he doesn't understand mam and how he just muted her in the last class. What we didn't realize that between all this his phone got unmuted and everyone heard it. 

So mam is like,"" Jayy, Can you repeat what you just said?"" And we too just froze there. He quickly muted himself while the teacher is still calling him. I couldn't stop my laugh. He is cussing at me while I am laughing. I don't know what happened in the next class but if something happened i will update it soon.

(This actuallt took place in my native language but I tried my best to translate it)

I am a high school student taking an online class as part of a program that a university offers to get college accreditation. In order to get credit for the course, I need to find a proctor for the midterm and final exams.

The program indicates acceptable proctors include librarians, independent proctoring services, or educational employees from my high school, but closures of libraries and most facilities due to coronavirus have effectively neutered these options.

Does anyone have any ideas on how I might be able to find a credible proctor for my exams in light of the virus? I know that online proctoring services exist, but I do not know much about them",1,1,angelastitties2

4407,guhdkd,2020-06-01 09:19:44,tifu,TIFU by joining the online class's voicechat with my shitty mic and social anxiety,"One of our profs encourages students to turn on their mics and participate in the online class. One certain student constantly joined the voicechat and sucked up really hard to the prof and it made me sick. So I decided to join the voicechat in today's class so I could have some showdown too.

But little did I know that my headset's microphone isn't as good as I thought, plus my social anxiety made me stutter and sprout incoherent sentences almost every time I tried to speak my mind. 

I didn't think that I did really bad until I downloaded the recorded session and saw the true span of my fuckup. Constant mic pops every time I said a word with P or F, incoherent sentences due to my social anxiety, one blow-in-the-microphone noise every minute or so of the entire class length, and to top it all, wrong answers. Example:

**Prof:** ""Ok, now what should the ideal ratio be?""  
*In my mind: ""The ideal width to length ratio should be 5.""*  
**Me:** (shitty mic) ""The ratio... **F**(mic pop)... **F**ive... width to... L... length""  
**Prof:** ""Incorrect.""

I couldn't see my classmates because they don't turn their webcams on, but I am almost sure that they cringed throughout the entire class and although I don't see them, I am deeply ashamed that I made an ass out of myself for an hour and a half in front of a class of 33 people. Maybe I deserve it for being a petty person who couldn't stand someone else getting favors and praises from the teacher. All I know is that I certainly fucked up.

4588,gjt3ce,2020-05-14 19:23:44,tifu,TIFU by swearing on a online class,"Today (surprise) I had a Maths class on Microsoft Teams. We've been doing that for some time and there have been revealed some problems from the platform like no difference between ""host"" and ""guest"", which lead us, 9th-grade fuckheads, to start abusing, like drawing in the ""whiteboard"" function, leaving it useless, and mute each others microphones.

&amp;#x200B;

Enough of background, I was having internet problems and couldn't hear my teacher speaking (and I believe she even made me a question). So, just for fun, I clicked on a friend of mine's image and used the ""poll"" function. It went like this in English:

Can you hear the class?

\&gt;Yes

\&gt;No

\&gt;What a big pile of shit I hear everything cutting

&amp;#x200B;

And then I sent it to him. But no no no... I sent it to the whole class. My teacher was sharing her screen and couldn't see it. Then, I tried to delete it, but it seems that polls do not have the option of being deleted. Well fuck me. Everyone started joking on WhatsApp (which we used to talk while we were having class). A friend of mine even started to just put dots on the Teams chat to hide my poll.

Realizing I just fucked up, I just wrote an e-mail to my teacher saying sorry even before she noticed what happened. I didn't have the courage to come back to class (which I mentioned in the e-mail, along with asking for her to not tell my parents). Anyways she got angry and told them. But that's when my checkmate comes, I told them before she would, 'cause we all know that teachers tend to make things a little more serious. They just laughed. A lot. Now the only problem will be facing her class next week.

TL;DR I sent a poll asking shit that was supposed to be for my friend, and ended up sending it to the whole class.",1,1,ThaSaltyBoye

5439,ftufvh,2020-04-02 20:59:17,ADHD,ADHD online class (2nd grade),"My 7 year old child with ADHD has been struggling with online learning.  I’ve spoken to two parents that go to a different school and both programs seem to be more of a flexible homeschooling option and neither offer an actual live lecture.  I do feel this would be a better option for my child even though she likes that she can see her friends in class.

She has a video lecture from 9-12 with two breaks in between (5-10 min).  She is now taking very short breaks every 30 mins in addition to that because she got to the point of resisting logging on at all.  She works at a fast pace and has trouble going slowly at the pace needed to keep the whole class on board.  

So we wind up having a parallel lecture while she has the mute button and she will be a page ahead sometimes and will be utterly bored /unfocused for the rest of the assignment, and when she is called on I point her to the question the teacher is on with the class, otherwise she would not know where they are at.

I would really like to get some ideas, whether this program seems too much at her age, or whether there is more I can ask for accommodation-wise.  Maybe what I am doing is all that I can really do; I feel like I could teach her more productively on my own because I can find ways to make it fun for her and during the lecture the only thing that she seems to be excited for is the next break.",1,1,icebreaker321

5818,fnvl03,2020-03-24 00:40:25,college,My University’s online classes are inconsiderate,"With the switch to online classes during the coronavirus outbreak, I can’t help but wonder what is the deal with the online classes. My biggest concern being that all of my profs. Are requiring us to have synchronous classes. Meaning we have to be in the online class at the same time we would be the regular class. This also applies to exams—we are limited the window of time that we would normally have in class on exams. Our exams will also be proctored by our prof. via webcam. I’m concerned about the time zone difference as what may be 10 AM ET would be 7AM PT. So my 7 AM class would become a 4 AM!? 

This is ridiculous to me, I understand ensuring we do not cheat on exams. But requiring us to be in “virtual classes” at synchronous times is an over reach. One prof. (who is head of dept. and tenured) claimed he would not accept any work outside of the class time. Most online classes are “at your own pace,” so I don’t understand why they are attempting to make us have actual class at home. The entire world is not on the same page, this is a global crisis. And no we should not just get an easy pass because it’s a crisis, but so much is neglected. I’m very concerned for my academic performance this semster.",1,1,a_g1246

Of course, I missed the fine print that this class I enrolled for was “continuing education” and therefore not for credit. The pandemic pushed the deadline for the university I hope for back to May 1, so my mom’s trying to tell me there’s hope. 

I can enroll for summer math course on April 13th, but transfer deadlines were March 1st and they take late people until the class fills up. I’m so scared I won’t be able to make it in, I can’t survive the school I’m at now. I want to get into this university so badly for its forensic psychology program, and to just get away from my current school. My mental health is at an all-time-low. I don’t know anymore.

6157,emg0ni,2020-01-09 21:10:39,tifu,TIFU by spending $106.25 on an access code for an online class that was inclusive access. (But I wasn't told was inclusive access),"This is the mandatory ""the fuck up didn't actually happen today"" but rather on January 7th of 2020. I went to VolBooks (the bookstore on my college campus) to buy books I needed for the spring semester of college. I printed my booklist and started grabbing books and adding up the totals to see how much damage I was about to inflict on my wallet. I grabbed the paper copies first and for reference, the first one was a $40 lab manual and the other was an $8.25 note taking guide for basic calculus. This is where stage one of my fuck up begins. The books on the list will be marked with ""IA"" either next to the title of the book itself or next to the price of the book to indicate that I don't have to pay for it as it is included in my tuition, hence the name ""inclusive access."" This is when stage two of my fuck up begins. The last item that WASN'T LABELED as IA was basically just an access code to a website called webassign. It holds the online textbook as well as all of my grades, homework, and lecture videos for my basic calculus class which is pretty important so I pick it up and see it is $106.25 (and I can not return it one the plastic film surrounding the booklet has been removed from it.)  I know it's required so I head to check out. My total was $188.90. (since I bought a new calculator, and a handful of other basic school supplies) Afterwards, I head back to my dorm happy because I have all of my required material and I'm ready to set up my online service seeing as my first class the next day is that basic calculus class. This is the final stage of my fuck up. I open the little booklet in it's plastic wrap and scratch off the film to reveal my code. Perfect. I follow the instructions on the booklet to log in to webassign using my email and password and then I should ""be promted to enter the code to gain access to my class."" HOWEVER. After I finish logging in, do you know what I see on the homepage? A banner saying that my class HAD ALREADY BEEN PURCHASED THROUGH INCLUSIVE ACCESS! So I just wasted $106.25 on an access code that I didn't even need because the course was covered in my tuition.

Tl;Dr: I didn't know the course was covered in my tuition so I bought the course for $106.25 thinking I needed it.",1,1,SquaisheyKat

So my school just announced that we wont have synchronous classes (synchronous means the teacher will teach and non synchronous means we only do assignments tasks etc) because it is time for completion of remaining tasks the some people might have not done yet. But i like to have free time as much as possible so i dont have any remaining tasks so i technically dont have to go to class. But i dont have much free time to myself where i get to do what i want on my own without anyone watching. When i do have classes they let me lock the door, my dad isnt a big fan of it but they still let me but the keys are right outside for safety purposes which get the reason why. It also lets me get away from doing chores, chores dont bother me much but i still dont like doing them. I played a few games youtube tiktok etc. But i did get pretty sleepy so i decided to take a nap. But i guess my nap was a little too long. I dont know what happened but i was woken up by my pissed dad with keys in hand. Ive had my experience in lying so i just said that i was waiting for the link to the class meeting but i fell asleep, i acted all surprised and all that. Luckily i got away with it without getting the slipper but now i cant lock my doors until my dad forgets about all this.

82,t4wgtv,2022-03-02 09:29:41,Philippines,Rant abt teachers sa online class,"I get it, we are all having a hard time sa online class pero napipikon talaga ako sa ilang naging teacher ko lately. I have this one specific teacher na sobraaang nakakainis, let's call him Sir G. 

I admit, Sir G is very knowledgeable in his subject. However, hindi sya magaling magturo. He doesn't bother to create powerpoint presentations at kung meron man, mostly hindi kumpleto, or doesn't even send out learning materials. He made a Google Classroom for our subject pero gusto nya sa Messenger isesend ang mga outputs, tapos hindi magseseen at magrereklamo na hindi mahanap ang output ng estudyante nya. His classes are definitely not engaging, yung tipong kaya naman matapos in 30-40 minutes yung topic pero pinapabaha nya into 2 hours. Mahilig din siya magpahiya ng mga estudyante during recitations. I just witnessed earlier how my classmate was so embarrassed sa sinabi ni Sir G sa sagot niya, to the point na nag-leave na lang siya ng meet. Kapag hindi nakasagot ang estudyante sa tanong niya ay automatic tatanggalin ka na sa meet. Another classmate admitted that he didn't know the answer to the question and Sir G removed him from the meeting. I think that classmate didn't attend any other synch classes sa subject ni Sir G after that. I also noticed na konti na rin ang pumapasok na estudyante sa meetings nya, compared sa other subjects namin na madalas kumpleto kami. Basta sobrang nakaka-drain ng mga klase nya, minsan 'di na rin ako pumapasok sa kanya kasi sobrang nakakakaba kapag ako ang natatawag at madalas hindi sya nasasatisfy sa mga sagot namin, kaya mas lalo syang napipikon. Para syang may anger issues and sht na 'di ko maintindihan at para bang anytime kaya nya kaming sigawan at mura-murahin.

Isa pa, yung adviser namin, isasama ko na yung adviser namin last year. Ewan ko ba kung nakakalimutan nila na may advisory class sila, pero hindi sila nag-aannounce samin, kung may pasok o wala, kung may important announcement sa school, o kung ano mang adviser duties na ginagawa nila. Pag may inquiries kami, napakahirap ma-contact. Kahit pa sa Messenger or email i-contact, wala! Tapos makikita ko na lang sa Facebook nila active na active hahahah. Palibhasa walang learning portal para sa amin at sa teachers namin, pero sa college department nila meron. Yung mga college may events, orgs, at semestral break. Kami, wala. 

Ayoko makarinig na ""aahh ganyan talaga mas malala na yan sa college"", well isn't it time for teachers to do better and fix their attitudes. Gets ko if they're not techy o medyo matanda na sila to understand the internet, pero I can differentiate those who are willing to try and understand from those who just doesn't give a shit sa mga estudyante nila. Some of us are really dragging ourselves para maka-graduate tapos magkakaroon ka pa ng teacher na masakit sa ulo.",0,1,shesthesister
83,t4lk59,2022-03-01 23:27:05,college,Professor won't unlock the midterm until the last day before spring break (asynchronous online class),"TLDR: professor didn't indicate until yesterday that the midterm would only be unlocked on this Friday (the last day before spring break.) I am leaving town and don't want to install Honorlock on my personal computer, so I have been using the library computer to take the proctored quizzes up to this point, and I don't know what to do. 

Okay so I am looking for a little bit of advice. I have an online class with a teacher who insists on using Honorlock to proctor every single weekly quiz in the class. I have my own issues with honorlock and don't want to install it on my personal computer. I emailed the professor about alternatives and she told me to set up an appointment with the testing center at the college. When I called the testing center they said that the professor had to contact them first and send them the quizzes. What I wound up doing was going to the library once a week on campus to borrow a study room and a laptop to take the quiz. 

First of all, I am not allowed to access previous quizzes without the Honorlock extension. Which means that I'm not allowed to use my previous mistakes to study for the upcoming midterm. 

I completed all of my coursework in advance so that my spring break would essentially start on Wednesday this week. Nowhere in the syllabus or on the modules did the professor ever list a date at which the midterm would be available. I started to think that the weekly quiz was mislabeled and is supposed to be the midterm. 

Yesterday she posted an announcement that the midterm would be available starting on Friday. The last day before spring break. It is available until midnight on the last day of spring break. I am leaving town on Friday, I planned this in advance and I worked my butt off to get all my classwork done so that I could safely do so without affecting my grades. By the time I get back into town, the campus will be closed until after the due date has passed. Even if it wasn't, I resent the idea that I should be forced to do a midterm exam during my spring break. 

My problem is that as things currently stand I would need to get to the campus first thing in the morning on Friday, hope that I could squeeze the midterm in and be out of there in time to drive 35 miles to the airport. I think it's also worth mentioning that I am physically disabled, so rushing around like that is not exactly easy for me. I had no indication that she would wait until Friday to make the exam available. She has not been helpful up to this point when I requested an alternative method of taking the quizzes and tests that DIDNT involve me being recorded. I am genuinely not sure what to do. 

Should I contact her and request to be allowed to take the test two days in advance, when I will be able to get to the campus? I have an ancient laptop that I don't use anymore that I could install the extension on, but I don't have a place in my home that satisfies the requirements of the proctoring (no writing on walls, no other people in the room, etc) and I would have to take down my entire computer setup (dual monitors) just to make it an acceptable testing environment. I feel as though letting us know on such short notice that the test would only be available for one day prior to spring break starting, especially since this is an online course, is unreasonable. But I have no idea how to pose that to her without making an enemy of the woman who decides my grade.",0,1,throwawaybcshylol

When I go to school, I leave everything I’m worrying about at the back of my mind because I have to focus on what I’m dealing with at present, i.e. the professor in front me giving a lecture. I can tell myself not to think too much about my other responsibilities since I need to accomplish my academic obligations while I am physically there inside the school. Then when I go home, I can do my responsibilities there and sleep after a very tiring day of acads and housework. 

During online classes, I can only avoid housework when I have synchronous meetings. That doesn’t spare me from my family members talking to me about what they need me to accomplish after the synch session is over. I’m serving two masters at once, essentially. 

Other than that, my day usually goes like this: 
I get out of bed to go do my work and when a family member sees me, they will ask me to do something for them. In the process of doing that thing, another family member will see me and ask me to do something for them, and so on. This happens until I have done all the chores and favors asked of me. By the time I am finished, I am too tired to think and move. I no longer have the energy nor the focus I need to attend to my academics. 

Yun lang naman. I used to tell myself na sobrang tamad ko and di ko deserve na mawalan ng gana mag-aral kasi nasa bahay lang ako. But then I realized na wala talagang gana mag-aral kung sobrang pagod ka na kahit hindi ka pa nagsisimula. 

It’s been more than a year and ganito pa rin yung setup and it hurts me because I know I am capable of more in terms of acads but this is the situation that I have to adapt to and live with. 

I wanted UP to teach me things that I wouldn’t be able to learn in books and so far this lesson has struck me the most since I confront it everyday: life will suck the happiness and energy from you but you still have to comply with its demands.",0,1,PalePils3n11

I have another student that hasn't accessed the course in 3 weeks, so part of me feels like maybe they're having a friend take the course for them but maybe I'm being paranoid and I'm not even sure if that's possible (because how could a student not in the class access the course to download materials?).

102,szx3ss,2022-02-24 00:47:29,college,Unpopular opinion: I like online classes more than in-person and I'm gonna tell you why,"I have heard a lot of people complain about online classes. They find that they are less motivated to do the work, there isn't much social interaction, and you basically have to teach yourself the subject. 

I hear you. I really do. It can be tough and frustrating at times. Especially when you have a question and instead of just raising your hand or swinging by your professor's office, you have to set up a zoom meeting or wait for an email response that will probably only answer half of your question. 

The thing I like about online classes, however, is that I can: 

* Work more during the hours I would have been stuck in a classroom
* No commuting to and from campus
* I can do the homework at a time that is convenient for me
* I can rewatch lectures if I don't understand it the first time instead of having to scribble notes as fast as I can and....oh he changed the slide before I could finish this chicken-scratch of a diagram that I won't be able to read later anyway. Sad. 
* Not have to put up with the loudmouths or know-it-alls in the classroom
* I can do the work anywhere I want in whatever outfit I want (the pajama game is strong)

For anyone who has issues with procrastinating like I do (literally me writing this post right now instead of doing Spanish homework), I recommend a couple of tricks I picked up after taking 10+ completely online college classes:

1. Make a schedule and put the due-dates of assignments a couple of days ahead of when they are actually due. This will (hopefully) help with not putting it off until the last minute. I figure that for small assignments, I need at least one day to do a good job and two to three days for bigger assignments. That way I can work on it in little chunks instead of sitting there stressing about a ten-page paper that's due by midnight the day you even think to start working on it. 
2. Work on it in bite-size pieces. Like I said, don't stress yourself out by trying to do everything the day-of. Break the assignment down into manageable chunks and do one part at a time. For a big research paper, for example: Set the due date for four days ahead.

* On **day one**, open the assignment and see what it's asking for. Start by figuring out what you're supposed to be researching. If you get to pick your own topic, spend the day finding something that both meets the papers criteria and that  also interests you. If that's the only thing you get done on day one, that's totally fine. You'll still have three more days to finish it, but at least you're slightly ahead of the game now. 
* **Day two** and **three** should be the actual research and beginning the paper. Try to finish the paper by day three if you can, but it's okay if it doesn't happen. Just try to get close.
* **Day four** is proof-reading and refining before submitting it that night. 

Another piece of advice: Actually email your professor if you get stuck on something. They usually offer online office hours and emails are highly encouraged. I have never had a professor be upset or bothered for me asking a question about something I didn't understand. You aren't bothering them, you aren't stupid for not understanding the material. Just. Email. Them. That's what you're paying them for anyway - to teach you. So let them. 

I could add so much more to this post but I'll leave it at this for now. I hope this eases your fears or unsureness of an online class. They aren't that bad and I actually really like them because of how flexible they are.",0,1,fluffynugget1116

183,scowax,2022-01-25 21:50:22,college,Rocketbook or Tablet Note taking for an online class - opinions?,"**Rocketbook system - What are your Pros/Cons?** So far limits on organization and available pages seems to be my biggest concerns

**Tablet note taking - do you feel it's as effective as pen and paper?** 

**Do you feel using a tablet for note taking in a home environment where you don't have to be super mobile is still worth the investment?**

**What android and iPad tablets do people suggest (300-800 tablet and pen budget)?**  

**Android people: What pen?  Comfort, Price, Sensitivity, Pen tip hardness matter?**

**What about a tablet to connect to a laptop?**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;!Background: My fiancé and I are non-traditional students returning to get our college education. I was at community college and after graduating a dual major transferred to university. My courses are now all online only. He is starting at community college before transferring to university. His classes will be a mix of in-person and online. We have a baby on the way, our first child, he works full time and commutes. I am currently not working. However, we both need to be able to mobile in our education (because of baby needs). We each have a laptop and desktop computer. I have a tablet that I've given to him.!&lt;

&gt;!We both prefer writing our notes. I don't want to use tons of paper, dividers, binders, etc., anymore!&lt;

&gt;!My BFF  learned about Notability and some other really neat apps for iPad that seem, from reviews and stuff, to make note taking, lecture/note integration, color coding, organizing, etc., really easy. !&lt;

&gt;!My biggest resistances initially were the cost of a new iPad and the pen. Also, integrating the iPad made documents to google drive, and accessing them from PC/Adroid programs. My resistances have waned some but not completely!&lt;

&gt;!My fiancé' has been glued to the tablet since he started classes. We did a little research and got him a lenovo pen for note taking. He's been VERY happy so far.  I'm not sure if, given our different note taking styles, that will be enough for me.!&lt;

&gt;!As I stated,  I started learning more about the android note taking market. I learned that for an android tablet we need to rely on apps and/or stylus with palm rejection for note taking to be efficient. I learned programs like OneNote and Evernote offer many features similar to Notability and other iPad (free apps) but do have premium services behind subscriptions. I also learned that there are different stylus for different writing styles (straight notes, drawing, etc.)!&lt;",0,1,anorlien

(But if you agree, please chime in and reinforce what I'm saying for the benefit of you lazy colleagues.)

You have no excuse for refusing to accept late work when you teach a class online and refuse to accept late work.  Accept it, and impose a 10% penalty like good professors do. 

(By ""good"" I mean someone interested in actually teaching people and empowering them.)

There is absolutely no justification for refusing to accept late work in a class offered online. **Classes are offered online because the schools know our economy keeps working class people so busy that they don't even have time to get to class.**  Tuition has increased at an insanely fast rate, too.  If you want your life and your work to be meaningful, make a decision to spend a little extra time and accept late work.   

Here's the correct way, and you can take it or leave it, depending on your values: If you teach an in-person class with mostly young college kids straight out of high school, then fine, use a policy of not accepting late work. Hold the little bastards accountable.  But if you teach classes online, it's a whole different ball game.  **People who take classes online should be treated as adults.  There's a reason they need to take the classes online.**  

Now I've explained it, and you no longer have any excuse. Maybe you saw it differently before, but now that I've spelled it out for you it's your burden to carry.  Refusing to accept late work from busy adults in online degree programs makes you an unethical person. It makes you part of the complacency degrading higher education in America.",0,1,JiminyCricket25

We're teaching online this semester, and I don't want to just not give the students the information they need. Do I cancel and go over tonight's concepts next week? Do I send them the material and have them read it on their own and email me questions? Do I record a lecture and send it to them?

i plan on coordinating 3 full days to schoolwork (mon/tues/thurs) since i have the full day open. i have a half day on sundays so that will be my relax day. i make spreadsheets that are color coordinated by class with due dates in chronological order that worked incredibly well for my fall semester. 

any other time management or general tips to handle the load?",0,1,cryosoleil

276,rl9j70,2021-12-21 07:49:15,college,Does anyone else actually prefer online classes?,"Junior in college here. For next spring I signed up for all online classes. When we went back to in person classes this fall it made me realize how much I actually prefer online classes. I’m more of an introvert, so everyone sitting in class with masks on listening to a lecture just leads to me to dwell in my social anxiety and makes it hard to concentrate, and I would end up skipping class almost every week (attendance not mandatory). 

With online classes it’s nice that I don’t have to commute everyday and am on my own schedule, plus none of the online classes I’ve taken so far have required attendance. I’m an IT/cyber security major and I have a nice desktop PC with a huge screen so it’s super convenient. 

I know most probably feel like you’d be wasting your college experience by doing this, but looking back I haven’t really made that many meaningful relationships or memories from the actual classes themselves. I think I might rejoin my fraternity that I dropped last spring and try to go up to the rec center a couple times a week to stay involved. 

Does anyone else feel the same way?",0,1,jclines12

280,rjbjpy,2021-12-18 16:57:47,tifu,TIFU by crying in recorded online class discussion.,"For your information, I'm 20f, a political science student in her 3rd year. Most of our classes are online due to the pandemic. So in one of the classes I take, the lecturer decided that he would give us room to share our thoughts upon the economic crisis our country faces (Turkey)

So, he asks what we think and I listen to some of my classmates before speaking. They have dreams. Most want to go abroad but don't have the budget for it, some want to go for other majors, the whole package. I feel very disheartened hearing those as it hit close to home.

So I take my turn and say that ""I had plans but I don't have them anymore. It feels like I have been working for nothing."" so he asks, ""Do you work?""

I respond as my voice quivers, ""I used to, but the company went bankrupt. I used to have plans but I don't have them anymore. I see no way to go abroad nor make a living like this."" I start crying. ""No matter how hard I work, it doesn't amount to anything. I'm so tired.""

The absolute low. Can't keep my composure. I try to speak but it's all jumbled. I apologize over and over again.

""Now I made others feel bad,"" I start to think. I say how this crisis takes so much from me and no matter how much I work, I might not even make the ends meet. It was a shitty situation tbh, to talk about something that tugs in your dreams for so long.
""Now I know why I didn't have the energy to speak in previous classes,"" I say. ""Studying felt all in vain too, a waste of days."" the class once again falls silent.

I think again that i shouldn't have cried. But the lecturer clears his throat and says that he has seen 3 economic devaluations, 2 earthquakes, unemployment, and yet he managed to get a PhD in the US and kept his hopes up, and became a professor.

He told us that ""I know it's hard, you are so young and you have dreams that are being crushed, but know that these kinds of crises end at 3 to 4 years maximum and there's an election. Don't lose hope""

I know he meant well. But our timeline is just not the same. He was able to go abroad but most of my peers aren't. The schools abroad won't accept us because we don't even have a penny despite how hard we work. I couldn't say we were different and that it's really hard right now. And all that emotional buildup is recorded lmao. I don't know. Nobody reached out for misconduct or anything. So that's good I guess.

TL;DR I cry in a class discussion about economic crisis, get some reassurance, still thinking I fucked it up.",0,1,Justatroubledgirl

Outspoken sila na sa up ako nagaaral kapag pinapakilala sa mga peoples nila.

Tell them of how they see firsthand, the struggles and difficulty of being a up student. Sana. I’ve been vocal to them about social issues, we either end up arguing or agreeing. May times na pinapatigil nila ako sa pagpopost/pagparticipate sa movement.

I’m applying for a master’s in teaching for K-8 and I still need to take an earth science course for my teaching endorsement. I decided to take a self-paced 100-level course at one of the local community colleges associated with the university because it seemed to fit my schedule and the credits would definitely apply to my plan.

The problem is, the professor in charge doesn’t do anything other than “ask for help if you need it.” The syllabus is just read the book, answer the questions at the end of the chapters, a few multiple choice exams in between. There’s no other resources, no PowerPoint slides, no recorded lectures, basically no help or teaching at all besides the textbook. I looked everywhere on Canvas searching for it but that really is it. I couldn’t believe it since I’ve never seen a course where the professor provides absolutely no teaching or resources. I emailed them asking if they had slides or lectures, or even if they know of other resources to point me to and they literally just said “look up online the terms you don’t understand.” 

So my question is, should I complain to the college about this? I’m about 1/3 of the way through the course and have an A so far. This was over $650 for the class and there’s no competent teacher and I feel very disappointed. I thought that since they charge the same amount of money as the regular scheduled class, the self-paced schedule would have the same quality.",0,1,bloo-dragoon

Not everyone can afford to be full-time students; many people are busy with part-time or full-time jobs, and many have families or other like obligations that take them away from studying. But even full-time students can struggle. Many come to us with questions like “Can you do many online courses?”

 The idea that online classes are super easy and require little or no effort is simply not true. These classes are designed by colleges and universities to be rigorous and to be equivalent to their in-class counterparts. That’s why we have developed a team of professional tutors, all of whom are graduates of some of the most prestigious colleges and universities in the country, and we have trained them so that they can do all of your homework and assignments with top grades. 

These tutors will log in to your online class with the login credentials that you provide, and they will complete all of your work by the deadline set in the course website. They will review all of your course material and organize a working plan to improve your grade so that you are no longer languishing at the bottom of the grade pool. 

 Our support team will assign a qualified tutor to your order and remain in touch with you every step of the way so that you can keep track of progress and be sure of the quality of work you are receiving. Our tutors will complete your discussions, homework, quizzes, tests, midterms, finals, essays, and more! Everything we submit comes with a grade guarantee of an A or B, and we hit this mark over ninety percent of the time! That is more than any of our competitors. 

And if you do experience any issues, you can count on us to be accountable. Our service is based in the United States, unlike our competitors which are based overseas in countries like the Philippines. What that means, besides easier accountability, is work of much higher quality.",0,1,normanboyster

592,pnmwb3,2021-09-13 19:48:02,college,Motivation/ work ethic/ time management for online class (USA),"This semester I had to take the entirety of my classes online. I have taken multiple online courses before at my college but, I've always had at least one in person. I am finding it extremely difficult to motivate myself to do the work lately. I feel super disengaged and dread looking on Blackboard. I am taking a language class over zoom which is pretty frustrating to have to learn a language while encountering every technical difficulty known to man. I'd love to hear from some other online students about how they navigate these online courses and how they stay motivated. Any tips or tricks are welcome.

I'm a university student and currently doing my bachelor degree. Currently, I'm having a online class because of COVID 19 and unfortunately my computer was broken and I desperately need some money to buy a new computer. I couldn't ask for money from my mother because she's a single mother who had a financial problem and she had to support my others siblings who are still studying in university and one of them is disabled.

1174,n454gc,2021-05-03 19:33:58,ADHD,Ways to unbloat Google Meet for online classes?,"Hey everyone, how are you all doing?  
I am having a bit of trouble with college for the past year, mostly regarding being distracted in my classes. I am on medication but I still find Google Meet way too distracting. Whenever I move my mouse the screen ""changes"" to reflect that I moved, peoples faces in the corner move around when someone talks, messages ALWAYS gets bubble notification on-screen (like, wtf?), if someone else has a camera on their movements ends up distracting me, the bottom menu with the buttons also kinda annoys me that they are always there and I get frustrated every time I stop paying attention to the class because I just noticed it...   


I searched around for extensions to change Meets behavior (like removing all the faces in the right as meet itself won't allow), and many other features, like not showing a bubble EVERY TIME someone send anything on chat, but haven't found anything useful. I am kind of ""tech savvy"", so I tried stuff like removing and/or blocking the right panel, modifying some stuff, but it always breaks, prevents me from accessing chat, reloads and comes back the same, and it's not even what I really want, and it usually takes time (distracting my from studying to try to find a way to ""fix"" Meet"").   


Do you guys have any good extensions that works with Google Meet? Scripts, ideias for what to do, anything really. I really need to figure something out. It's been a year already and it's not gotten any better. Doesn't matter the platform, I can move around to any browser to have this behaviour changed.",0,1,mefudi

This happened an hour ago.

I had a surgery class, the professor was late, so I left the phone and went on my laptop to watch some Ludwig on YouTube.

For a solid 10 mins I was unmuted. in front of 120 people. my friend messaged me on telegram about 25 times, One of them even sent me a phone message, but of course, I didn't hear it since I'm on laptop.

All of this seems like a harmless funny embarrassment that I would've just laughed on and moved on.

The real problem is that when the professor finally came, he started to explain why he was late and how he fixed it.

I refluxing-ly answered something like ""Good for you"" or ""Well done, and?"". sarcastically.

he then answered me in the most annoyed voice possible ""thanks dude"". 

Then it hit me.

&amp;#x200B;

now I'm asking you, how can I  change my name and what is the best college/city to move to, cause I sure can't show my face in this class anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

1886,l48upm,2021-01-24 22:05:22,tifu,TIFU everyone saw me jerk off dick and all in online class was told to post from r/teenagers.," Light glitch on my camera. Well I'm in high school turning 15 (I am a male) next week, and yeah. Also I get horny as I'm sure many of you do. I'm chilling in my online math class, and I suddenly get the urge to jerk one. So I decided to turn off my camera or so I naively thought. This teacher was in her mid 50's old teacher, and she didn't know how to work the google meets well. Here is the part where I massively fucked up. Usually when my camera is on there is a bright small light coming out from my computer. When I ""turned off my camera"" that light went off. I usually double check to make sure. I was sitting in my bed which is by the wall, and there I put on some headphones and listened to some sweet porn. I whip my dick out, and start beating it after a little while I finish up naively thinking everything was alright. After class ended I got spammed from a friend of mine in the class that the entire class watched me jerk off dick and all. He said that ""dude your so fucked, you fucking idiot how the hell did you not know that your camera was on"" ""I said no, no, you didn't it the light was off no way, everyone saw me. Then he showed me the video which he took to me beating my meat in front of the entire class. I naively thought that just because the light was off my camera was off. I think what happened was that I miskicked and thought I turned off my camera when I didn't. I proceeded to skip the rest of class, and sit in my room thinking about what i'm going to do when I go back to school on Monday. (I have a hybrid schedule 2 days in person 3 days online. Apparently I also heard that the teacher tried turning off my camera, but due to her being old and not so great with tech she had no idea how. So everyone watched me jerk off dick and all in online class. What do I do? TLDR Jerked off in class everyone saw my dick now wanna die.",0,1,lmacool

1967,l0i6q7,2021-01-19 11:38:25,tifu,TIFU by putting off doing my online classes,"TL;DR I put off my online classes for two quarters to the point where I now have to do 5 entire modules and change in a week and probably will fail the class.

I've always had issues getting stuff done for classes at home because I have trouble getting into a ""work mode"" when I'm at home. Generally I do all of my work in class quickly and efficiently, spend time making sure it's good and correct, then I submit it.

Well with covid starting and with my mental health starting to take a dive I decided to try online classes again because it would be easier. That was my first mistake. The counsellor told me that psychology only had 5 total modules, but they were pretty simple and mostly just answer questions, so it would be a good start as it also aligned with one of my interests. I ended up putting a lot of the work off, though I did get about 3/4 of a module done a week for the first 3 weeks. Then when it came time for the quarter to end I hadn't realized that I was missing units, so I couldn't just run through them all in a couple weeks.

I realized there was no way I could even finish in the first quarter, but thankfully there was a way to extend to the next quarter, so I decided to do that, thinking it would be fine. I asked for all the units except the ones I had in advance so I could work on them, only to end up putting them off for a while again, up until a couple weeks before the end of the quarter. I hadn't learned my lesson.

Now I'm a week before the end of Q2, and I've just noticed my work isn't 5 modules.... It's 5 units, two of which have two modules. I now have to speedrun 5 modules and the rest of the things I hadn't finished by friday or else I fail the class.",0,1,ShadoKitty
1973,l0cxx1,2021-01-19 05:15:38,CollegeRant,Conflicted feelings about online classes,"Hey everyone,

I hope everyone is doing as best as they can through these tough times.

There’s not much of a purpose for this post, just some stuff I wanna get off my chest.

So I’m about to start my second semester of online classes at home. I have a pretty good home life, but I’m getting kind of sick at being at home. My mom is kinda controlling and I feel like I’m not able to be as independent as I want to be. I have sibling who gets to live with her friends in an apartment (some in person classes), and as more time passes by, the more envious I am :(

Here’s the thing though, I don’t really mind online classes. It’s nice have more time outside of class to get shit done and being able to speed through recordings is awesome. I’m also a homebody...

I like spending time with my family, but I think what like more is just having people that I’m comfortable with just being near me, even if we aren’t talking.

I want to go back in person, but at the same time, I don’t. I wish I leaned more one way than the other, but damn, it’s hard.

I don’t have a solid group of friends (I wish I did), but I do have a few really great friends. 

I feel like I’m always pressured to say things like, “I can’t wait to go back on campus” and “I miss dorming” when in reality, I just don’t. 

I don’t really feel lonely at home, which is great. But I don’t want to be stuck here. I know I need to get out and leave once classes go back in person. But the thought of that doesn’t really make me feel excited. 

The pressure of having a bigger social life from people around me stresses the shit out of me, they make me feel abnormal. 

I’m scared for my social life after college (junior now). I love talking to people, but scared of the lack of opportunities. 

I’ve experienced loneliness a couple times in college (when I lived on-campus) and damn, it’s one of the worst feelings, for me at least.

Anyways, if you’ve read this far, thanks and good luck. We will get through this!",0,1,Purple__turtle5737

2090,kv5yp5,2021-01-11 16:23:51,socialanxiety,Scared of going back to normal but also scared of online classes.,"Hello, this is my first post here.

I'm scared of going back to ""normal"" but also scared of online class meetings.

I'm in college/university and scared of going back to normal because I will have to interact with people and there's this one Professor who will pick random people and ask a question about the subject.
This Professor also does one ""oral exam"" as part of the grade, call your name and you sit in front of his desk and answer questions about the subject studied.(idk if I explained that well enough).

While we were doing online classes he would ask me    random things almost every class and I would always answer them wrong and feel very embarrassed to the point that I couldn't pay attention to what he was saying because of my anxiety and began to hate that day of the week.

I can't ask him for help with stuff from the subject because I'm scared of him, that he will think I'm dumb or to mess up my words.

And now this new semester we'll have class with him and I can't sleep thinking about it.

Can someone please help me with this or give me some advice?

I’m the quiet kid, this is embarrassing asf. Me and my friends (who don’t go to the same school) was on discord while I was on a meet with my class. I had my speaker on chrome while my headset on discord. 

The teacher asks the class a question and our class needs to take turns talking. After I spoke I forgot to mute my mic becuz my friends kept yelling. 

Then I tell them to shut the fuck up and starts to play “Die Very Rough” on my speaker becuz we’re playing hide and seek in CS:GO. My speaker yells out the lyrics “i’m a big dog, big bear, n*gga, I’m a lion. I’m the predator of the prey that is hiding.... don’t you run from me lil n*gga”

Then my teacher starts to yell after me and I realized I fucked up. The whole class and my friends is dying of laughter. I’m stupid.

This happened about 3 hours ago.

TL;DR: I was on discord call with my friends while on a meet. Teacher asks me a question, I answer. My friends kept yelling and I forgot to mute my mic. Then I turn on “Die Very Rough” and my teacher starts to yell at me. Everyone in my class is laughing and I’m embarrassed.",0,1,SkoglundTheGreat

i'm normally an all a's with a couple b's student. with sheer force of will and keeping a very strict routine i used to be able to do well in academically with a lot of effort. now that college is online (and almost all asynchronous), my days blur together, i can't focus on anything, 3 pm becomes 3 am in a blink, and each class has a million little tasks thats just become so overwhelming. my profs have been so understanding this semester and didn't penalize me for late submissions but that just means i kept falling behind more and more. i'm only in 4 classes and now i'm not passing 3 of them. i know im going to sound ungrateful because i should be counting my blessings for the fact that my parents pay for school but i know theyre going to cut me off financially when they see these grades and its piling up the stress.

i wish my profs didn't just give me a simple thats ok take your time when i told them adhd was making me fall behind. i wish they checked in and helped me make a plan to keep myself on track when i didn't submit anything for a month. but i know thats not their job and they're not trained to do it so i can't even blame them.",0,1,peachhangover

Recently, the teachers kept saying that they can mark you as not in class if you don’t answer them (like a basic I’m here message) and they will start opening our cameras and microphones.
Today, our teacher asked one of my friends to open her camera, and she said that her environment wasn’t suitable, so our teacher said that she would give her a minus which affects our performance notes. She messaged the answer to our teacher, so it’s not like she didn’t solve the question.

2651,jz2z66,2020-11-22 20:36:05,CollegeRant,Grade dropped exponentially because of online classes,"I had journalism as a Gen-Ed this semester. The professor was a really cool guy, around 72. We would normally talk about how to write stories, what was going on in the world, and life lessons. It was easily my favorite class, and I picked up writing stories quite fast; he told me I was doing leagues better than some people. Once spring break hit, my midterm grade was an A.
Then corona hit and classes became online. That transition was...rough to say the least. Even though I lived at home, I did a majority of my work on campus because working from home is difficult because I get distracted easily at home. 
All of my professors communicated and gave assignments through D2L, except my journalism professor, who talked exclusively through outlook/student email. As for someone who rarely checks his email, this sucked. I missed some assignments and even turned my final in late, resulting in the D. He emailed me after grading it and saying that he understood, and teaching online was awful for him. What’s worse is that I was focused on making sure my other grades didn’t fall, so I ended up with 2 As, 2 Bs and a glaring D. Now my parents want to see my grades because they are helping me pay for college, and I have to explain al this to them (even though I know they won’t understand).

TL;DR: Was an A student on campus, final grade was a D when online ended.

The people in my class seem really nice, and I always thought that maybe I could make friends with at least someone there. Theres also someone in the class that I'm kind of interested in. Its the one class that I'm taking this year that actually relates to one of my passions, unlike the classes I'm taking for my degree.

I always end up crying after the class no matter what, because I always feel so left out. At this point I know theres no hope in trying to be social in that class. Another semester has gone by, and I still haven't been able to open up. I actually got to talk to some people in the class in a breakout room, including the person that I'm interested in. I was proud of myself at first because I actually talked and opened up more than I usually do. But I think in the end I probably came across as really weird.

The thing that makes me cry I think is the fact that everyone in the class seems to be doing fine with talking to one another. And I just feel so left out of this class. Its one of the only times I've gotten a chance to connect with someone outside of my degree, and I just hate myself for being the way that I am. I wish I was brave enough to put something funny in the chat like everyone else does while the teacher isn't looking. And I wish I was able to talk normally during that stupid breakout room. I'm so tired of feeling like no one likes me, and that no one will ever like me. I'm afraid that I'm just going to be boring and nervous for the rest of my life in front of people.

My college has gone remote due to COVID, so I've been taking classes from home, and I'm off campus.  Through online courses, though, I've found that I've been having a lot of trouble saying people's names correctly, and I feel really awful about it.  For example, if I'm on Webex, sometimes the names of the people come out differently than the nickname, and I feel awful when I call someone by the name they listed there, but I later realize their nickname is something else.  Similarly, when I'm talking and trying to shout out my classmates, I feel awful when I mispronounce it.  

In fact, today in one of my classes I was trying to praise one of my classmate's comments, and my computer while typing autocorrected it to another name!  I felt really bad and tried to correct it to their actual name real fast, but the damage was definitely done. 

Do any of you all happen to have tips as to how I can manage praising my classmates for awesome comments without continuously messing up their names?

If you happen to be in a class with me, I'm sorry I keep messing it up!  I truly hope you all know I don't mean it!

2800,jt7kg3,2020-11-13 01:10:39,Professors,How can one more easily track attendance with online class meetings?,"I have been offering extra credit for students to attend a few optional zoom sessions.  I know that you can look at the usage reports on Zoom and see who has attended.  I can download the excel files for each session, remove duplicates, and try to sort the names alphabetically.  However, I think there must be an easier way for me to grade attendance.

Partway through, (tmi but) I needed to use the bathroom and I figured it would take long enough that if I didn't want to miss notes I needed to take my laptop with me. Kinda gross, but I didn't want to miss stuff. I realized that I focused way better in there. Probably because it's a small, boring room and I didn't bring my phone with me because I already had my laptop. My zoom tab + microsoft onenote take up my whole screen so it's hard to do other things at the same time unlike when I can just pull out my phone.

Then the professor pointed me out that I want to say something. Of course, I wasn’t. I haven’t been concentrating the whole lesson 😂 .Then I told her I am just pressing random stuff to test the app, sorry. Went fine with her.

I am trying to participate, but sometimes he can’t hear me because lots of students are reciting simultaneously. Earlier, he called me out for not reciting. I felt so nervous and was about to have a panic attack. But then, I recited then he commented “it’s your first recitation” in front of the class. I felt so ashamed and embarrassed of what he did. Do you guys experience this? Or do you have any tips to overcome my anxiety when it comes to participating? I almost know all the answers but sometimes I’m afraid to speak because of my prof’s high expectations.",0,1,urenchantment

Usually I get to do online lessons in my room by myself with camera and microphone off, so teachers can not see what I’m doing but today I had to do it in front of my mom and sister with the camera and microphone both on. Really l lucky for me my brain decided that staying still or focusing was not an option. At the start of the lesson I was stim central, I calmed down a bit (note: not a lot) but when however much time passed (idk if it was 15 or 40 minutes please don’t hurt me) I was out of it
Well my mom noticed, glared at me a bunch and  after the lesson yelled at me. She looked exactly like mrs trunchbull lol. Even overthinking me thinks she went OTT like I wasn’t launching a nuclear strike jeez.

3291,j1mj4h,2020-09-28 22:31:09,college,Does anyone have tips for taking over a full load of online classes?,"I feel like I am going to have a mental breakdown if one more thing goes wrong this semester. I finally decided to take a full load of classes this semester while I am out of work and I am struggling to understand and complete the work load every week. I turn in mostly everything, but there is always a class I have to neglect every week. I like to read the textbook because thats where I understand the material the most, but all the supplemental material throughout the week prevents me from being able to read the chapters for the week until next week comes around and a while other set of assignments/projects/essays/discussions are due. I feel like I am drowning and am not getting a proper grasp on the material.

Not to mention, the online format has caused me to make several errors. On a online test, I typed up my answer in the answer box and then accidentally hit two keys on my keyboard that erased the entire response. Since I had to rewrite the entire response, I ran out of time before completing the LAST TWO questions of the exam. For some reason, he made these last two questions worth 30% of the points on the exam in total. So I will be guaranteed to get less than a 70% on the quiz even if I got everything else right. This ended in a quick cry sesh with my cat because I studied really hard for that exam. 

Today, I was so caught up in a assignment from another class that somehow I had it in my head that my 3rd lecture of the day didnt start until 12pm. I logged into Zoom at 12pm and realized my lecture actually started at 11am. The shitty thing about this is we had a quiz worth a lot of points at the start of the lecture (open from 11am-11:17am) so I missed that. Its going to bring my 89% down to a 73% in the class. It just hurts that such a mindless mistake messed with my grade so much. I knew all of the answers on that quiz as well so I could have gotten a 100% but instead got a 0. I had to get up and go for a drive after that.

Grades are really important to me and I’ve tried to be a really good student throughout my college years. Last semester I got straight As but it seems like this semester is going to go as smoothly. I feel like Ive already made too many mistakes. How can I fix this and do better the rest of the semester so that I dont drag my GPA down with me?",0,1,sammireneeecx

3354,iyp4kf,2020-09-24 03:06:36,CollegeRant,So done with one of my online classes and just online classes in general,"So, I'm a dual enrolled sophomore in college (junior in HS) and I've just kinda hit a point of being done. Like, I've gotten sooo lucky with my professors, they're doing the best with what they've got but it's still so frustrating, especially for someone who learns really well in a classroom environment and not from videos. The one professor who is really bugging me right now is my Honors Explorations professor. 

My college makes us go through basically a study skills/college success skills class before letting you take any Honors courses. So, I received my invitation and decided that I would get the class over with this semester, that way next semester I can take my first official Honors Course. Well this class is basically a waste of time. He 'taught' us how to find peer reviewed sources on the databases, we have to do butt tons of discussion posts which causes forced and graded discussion which is more stressful than interesting or helpful, and we have to write like five papers over the semester. Now, five 1,000 word or more papers aren't that bad. For the final paper and the next paper we write, we have to make an office appointment with him and go prove that we read the book for the paper or go give a presentation. This also may require that we go to his office at a campus that is over an hour away from where I live to go prove to him that I read a book. He also has the descriptions and the due dates for these upcoming papers all weird so that they are literally due 1 day apart... Yeah. So, at this point I just want to say screw it and drop it, but if I make it out of this class and complete three more honors courses I'll be able to graduate with honors, which will help me in the future.

I don't know, I'm just going to deal with it, but it feels nice to rant to people who might kinda understand where I'm coming from.

TL;DR: Tired of Honors orientation course due to large amount of requirements and the professor's inability to correctly write an assignment page/put in a due date. Also, online classes suck for people who hate videos (aka me).",0,1,PsychGirl03

To spend $20 to go to a 90 minutes class feels heavy for someone who supports herself. Since my college does online class for each courses, I decided to save that $20 every Friday and attend online. I sent my lecturer a nice, dainty email explaining why.

My lecturer wouldn't reply. It's been almost three days. I can't attend the online class if she doesn't give me the link. I have sent the same email twice, just in case if she missed the first. Turns out, I'm not the only one who has been ignored. Some of my classmates experienced the same.

What do I do?

I’m taking an online psychology class, because psych has always been a huge interest of mine, and I hope to become a therapist. The class however has been a huge struggle for me, with error after error on my part. 

First I missed a bunch of assignments at the beginning that were on an external website, because on canvas they had no due date but the deadline was outlined on the syllabus, and the external website itself. I of course failed to visit the website in time, as I thought I could do the assignments at anytime and also failed to read the syllabus clearly. 

My 2nd mistake was simply not studying correctly, as I essentially failed the first midterm. I missed alot of information in the heavy reading we had to do. I had been doing all of the assignments but it wasn’t enough. I was lost. 

Lastly, I had my 2nd midterm today, or so I thought. After procrastinating, I logged on to take the midterm only to find out that the period to take it was from Thursday 12am-11:59pm. I had been so terrified of the 2nd midterm after my failure of the first I hadn’t even bothered to check the date. The last midterm had been on a Friday and for some reason when I looked at the date weeks ago I assumed the second was on Friday. I even requested today off from work a week ago in order to have a full day for my midterm. 

Now I’m sitting here, feeling completely broken. How do I tell my parents. Time and time again I make the same mistakes, and they tell me I don’t care and I’m not trying hard enough. I’m starting to believe them.

4174,hnrgmi,2020-07-08 22:51:11,teenagers,I thought having two online classes was a good idea.,"Not only that but they are both music, so I thought it would be kind of fun

All that until I realized that there’s a lot more work than I expected 

And I don’t mean just, its a college class so off course its harder. I mean it’s extreme for that. One of them (music fundamentals) is fine, it’s a lot of work but not crazy. Like 10 hours a week. 

But then theres music appreciation which is kind of ridiculous 

I have to do like 14 chapters a week (multiple long assignments each)

Honestly these two classes alone are more than full days at school were, and my last year was pretty hard

And off course this would be fine in a vacuum but there’s other things I have. Plus my parents are being jerks and overly controlling, and complain cause Im “in my room too much.”

They said “your not really spending all that time doing school”

Well a few days I spent maybe half an hour taking a break. Then they’ll say “but you were telling us about gregorian chants and classical music”

Well, what do you think we were learning about? Music appreciation is mostly music history, and Im not sure if your aware, but the classical period was a pretty important part of musical history. Important enough that I had spent time learning about it to improve music/composing before this class. (And have written some chamber music)

And they on monday decided to turn the internet all day and most of tuesday morning. Forcing me to fall behind, and miss a midterm test. Dropping one grade from above 100% (extra credit) to a low D and now im behind on the other clas. Not to mention not being able to learn what I was expected to yesterday.

The class I was doing well in one or two days Id just not do work for so I could catch up on the other class

But now if I do that I drop from a D to an F. And it also takes longer since im catching up on what I missed for both classes

Also, since Im doing so much writing and taking notes and using my computer I got a repetitive use injury, and now I have a cast that makes it soo much harder that I honestly can’t focus for long periods anymore. Right after I was screwed over.

TLDR: I went from having a hard time in one class and an easy time in another to barely passing both because my parents are jerks. Because of that I normally had everything done by like 4-5 but yesterday I missed something at 5 and still couldn’t finish everything.",0,1,Kar1Mark

I feel like even people without ADHD would take hours. it's physically uncomfortable and aversive to sit and look at a screen or a book and just read hours and hours of writing and then on top of that have to do all this writing. it's also really hard to understand half of what I read and then answer half of the questions I have to answer. it's been awhile since I've been in school so all of my coping skills I used to have I forgotten so I don't even remember how I used to get through all this. Luckily my job is off at the moment so I can spend the day doing work but I'm going to have to take classes once my job starts back up and I'm not going to be able to afford to do I've already decided to only take one class of semester onI've already decided to only take one class of semester once work gets back going.

So I am in my first year of masters degree and we've been having online classes for the past 2 and a half months basically. We are using Microsoft Teams for the classes.

Now each professor created a recurring event for the classes so we would be notified of the class. I have this email synced to my gmail on my phone so I see all of these events in my Google Calendar.
Well this is our last week of classes (actually we only have exams now), so I thought ""hey, these events are cluttering my google calendar, i'm gonna delete them"". So I deleted them. It must have been like 10 events at least.

Soon after I start getting messages from my classmates and they're screenshoting their email clients. As it turns out they all got an email for each event I cancelled. So not one email, not two emails, but rather 10 emails. In a span of a minute. For some reason Microsoft Teams sends an email to everyone in that event if you cancel it (if you cancel it in Microsoft calendar, you can choose not to send it, but not so in Google Calendar).

And since it's exam week they've all been studying and I interrupted them.

Well no harm no foul, at least I don't have to see them for another 4 months.

TL;DR: I cancelled all recurring events for online classes and spammed my classmates with at least 10 emails during exam week.",0,1,Imprompterus

4457,gr4rfk,2020-05-26 20:17:55,tifu,TIFU by not muting my microphone during an online class,"Okay, a little bit of background: 
First of all bear with me, English is not my first language, I’m really sorry if you don’t understand. 
I was in an english online English class. Usually when I join a class where I don’t have to talk too much, I do it with my computer which has a microphone that doesn’t work. So when the teacher wants me to say something I have to write it but I usually don’t have much time (I’m a slow typer) and the teacher goes on with the class without my slow response. Or another problem that I ALWAYS have is that I don’t know where the heck we are, maybe we are correcting a listening exercise but I’m on another page pf the book and I don’t understand anything so when the teacher calls me: first I have to specify in the comments that my mic doesn’t work, then I have to ask where we are and then start answering (most of the time I answer the abswer to another exercise). Because of this, I don’t have the best marks in class. I just remembered that I always talk to me during classes.

Okay, so an hour ago I was at an online class and the teacher kept calling other classmates and not me (I usually don’t participate in class because I’m shy but I needed to lift up my marks). This time I could talk because I was using my phone and I knew what we were correcting. So I started getting a little nervous because there were only 20 minutes left and I hadn’t talked during the whole class. 

After asking if I could talk and answer the question she chose another girl so I said that she never chose me (ay dale miss, nunca me elegis. Sos joda?) and then I didn’t hear anything else. I looked at my classmates and some of them were containing their laughter. Then it hit me...I hadn’t muted my microphone.

I instantly muted it and i also turned off the camera. I started freaking out (I’m very sensitive I know). Then my classmates started sending me messages laughing and saying that I ruined it so I started laughing too. After two more questions the teacher called me and asked me I don’t remember what but when I was trying to answer I started laughing and couldn’t control it and she was looking at me weird so I had to mute again the microphone until I calmed down. 
This happened an hour ago and she just sent me an email. If my parents know they will kill me

TL;DR: Forgot to mute microphone during online class and kinda insulted the teacher.",0,1,Bananalanascal

To accommodate international students, they're shifting our schedule so that almost all of our classes are early in the morning (7-9am) or late in the evening (7-9pm). I feel like that isn't going to work for me at all. I have insomnia and can't get up early, but also, by the end of the day my brain is shut off (plus, my medication doesn't last that long and I can't take it later or I don't sleep). I go to a college that doesn't have any night classes, and our earliest ones start at 8:30, so this is a huge change. 

I'm applying for an accommodation for early class registration so I can have a schedule that suits my needs, but if all of the scheduling is this extreme then that might not matter. Also, my school has historically been very strict about accommodations and I'm skeptical that I'll actually get what I need.  

Is anyone else facing similar issues? Is this kind of schedule ADA-compliant? What are some possible accommodations I should apply for?

For those websites that doesn't let you open the same duplicates of the tab of the website on a search app just open all of the internet browsers you have and go to that same website and you can start watching 2 or more at the same time

5319,fwyt1v,2020-04-08 03:21:12,college,A few weeks into online classes and I've already been accused of cheating. Hatred of online exams grows.,"Well this situation just gets more lovely by the day. I was informed that I will be receiving a zero for an exam I took online because I've been accused of cheating. I'm not completely faultless here, since I was in a call at the time (was not speaking) and was troubleshooting on the device to ensure the integrity of the call while going through the (EASY) exam on a different device. I guess I'm kind of dumb sometimes and to me it seemed like no big deal, but when I got assigned a zero the professor included a clip from the recording of me taking a pause from the exam and doing stuff on my laptop. To a teacher I understand why this looks suspicious, and I realize it wasn't a good idea to have another device out and also be working on it simultaneously with the exam. However, with the call logs showing I was indeed in a personal call at the time (with someone not enrolled at my university or with knowledge of the exam material), and the person being able to support the fact that I was trying to fix my device, I feel that the recording is not clear or substantial evidence that I was viewing exam-related material at the time. My university requires clear evidence for accusations of cheating, as stated in the academic honesty code. I considered accepting a zero because I agree that I should not have used a different device during the exam, but I would fight any harsher punishments. The more I think about it the more I want to fight receiving a zero as well due the complete lack of evidence from the professor and supporting evidence of my claim. In my opinion, the recording holds nothing of value since I can prove my actions were innocent and unrelated to the exam, and my previous exam grades demonstrate I have a grasp of the class material.

I already wasn't fond of all these privacy-violating proctor services. From previous exams I knew there was a process of taking a face pic, showing ID and surroundings, so I wanted to see what I had to do for this exam since it used a different proctoring service. My ID had to be scanned, and it wouldn't even take it for the longest time until I eventually got lucky. After this infuriating struggle to have my ID accepted I decided I better go ahead and take  the exam so I don't have to go through that again. If not for this, I would've waited until I wasn't in a call to take the exam. Now that I realize you can get accused of cheating simply based on eye movements and looking at another screen without that screen's content being visible, I hate these online exams and proctoring services even more. I believe this system is flawed and supports a ""guilty until proven innocent"" process of justice. If anyone has any advice or similar stories I'd love to hear it.",0,1,willdojohns

5470,ft794t,2020-04-01 19:52:20,tifu,TIFU by swearing in an online class,"This happened e few hours ago. We were in an online class and my friends were doing a presentation about COVID-19 because the class required it or something. So while they were doing their thing, I was very busy playing DOOM Eternal and trying to 100% it.

So I was in the Cultist Base level and those slithering fuckers really screwed me up because I wasn't using the Ice Bomb. We're using Microsoft Teams to have our online classes and the shortcut to enable your mic is pressing the combination of ""Ctrl + Shift + M"". Now, as you may know I press Ctrl and Shift a lot in this game. But my hand never slipped to press M. Even If I had, the selected window wasn't Microsoft Teams. So I guess it has this weird-ass feature of enabling your mic if you speak too much.

I shouted ""I'LL FUCKING KILL YOU!"" to those fuckers. I saw a message on Steam from a friend saying that I swore in class and our class WhatsApp group went wild. I assured myself that my mic was disabled and I picked up my phone, to see 2 unanswered calls from 2 of my best friends from class. There was silence.

Appearently the teacher decided to ignore the fact that I swore in front of more than 60 people and started recording the session... I turned my microphone off for the rest of the day and kept playing DOOM...

TL;DR: I swore to virtual demons in front of 60+ people including a teacher in an official university online lesson session, and the teacher decided to ignore it.",0,1,thesowil

I am asking all those who have had successful online classes to please share what they think is the most beneficial for this setup. Group calls are out of the picture granted that not all students have a stable connection to support the call.

Plus I am NOT an aural learner (possibly due to autism rather than ADHD, I can't process voices very well) and I get next to nothing out of lecture classes. I miss my seminar class because it was actually engaging, but otherwise the rest of the semester is going to be good for me.

Took an online class before I was medicated and it was ten kinds of dog shit for me (took one after meds and it was the most productive schoolwork I've ever done) so if you're not on medication or it doesn't work very well you seriously have my sympathies, though.

But, my point is, if you've never done it online before don't despair, you might do a lot better being able to choose to work when you have the highest levels of focus.",0,1,meradorm

5931,fljqvv,2020-03-19 22:58:53,teenagers,The problem with online classes,"I have so many problems with online classes. To get a better understanding of what I am going to tell you, I possibly have ADHD. This will make everything more clear. Every class in school we have to do something at home, (2 of which I don't even know because I haven't been at school for a couple of days and my friends aren't getting any information.) The main problem with ADHD is if you are doing something you don't enjoy, you loose focus fast. If we are doing a subject I don't enjoy, I have to get it done within about 10-20 minutes before I'm done. When that does happen, literally anything becomes more interesting than what I am supposed to be doing. Now here is the problem: working from home or doing school from home sounds nice but suddenly you feel like you are at your office or in your classroom and you feel like things that you use everyday become unusable. Which in turn will make you want to use them more. Just sitting at my desk looking at my keyboard I can see my computer screen, TV, phone and Wii. Since I am enjoying writing this post, I am maintaining focus mostly (until I heard something coming from the other room and started to blast it from my phone to make my mom and my moms BF laugh). If I were doing work, if my phone went off, I would check it immediately, if my computer were on, I would open YT or reddit. My TV isn't on a lot but I would definitely say it would be far more entertaining. What I am saying is, teachers should just give us the extra weeks vacation, after all, it is the governments choice to close schools for an additional 2 weeks. How do teachers know students aren't cheating? How can they expect students to do work when while off school they probably have better things planned? It's just fucking stupid.

That is all.

5946,flepvg,2020-03-19 18:12:28,college,Didn’t get much of a response from professor when I addressed concerns about online classes,"So I emailed my professor for my communications class about my situation. I posted about it already but basically I live in a small apartment with 6 other people, two of them being 2 and 5. So it is indeed very loud in my small living space and very distracting. I don’t have the luxury of having a designated study area, I don’t even have a desk. I don’t have an option of going outside to a cafe or something either as I have ppl of high risk living with me and wouldn’t want to put them in danger due to virus. So I email my professor explaining this while also adding that I of course understand how frustrated she most likely is. To have to move a class based on face to face interaction online must suck. She responded saying she understands my concerns and that she is already making adjustments to the syllabus and trying to figure out how we will present online but just ends with telling me to download zoom on my phone and laptop. I know she can’t drop everything just to help me since she has many other students and still trying to figure things out herself, which I totally get, but idk the response didn’t really seem helpful? Or didn’t really suggest what I could do. I know we have to do online classes no matter what, but it’s really not much of an option for me to have live classes. I’m happy I’m with my family but for doing online classes I wish I had my dorm room since I had a quiet space and a desk.

Guess it’s also like “what do I expect?” Like what is she supposed to do? I really chose the worst semester to take communications",0,1,BaiChun956
